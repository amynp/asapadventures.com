It was time to leave Cambodia. We were picked up at 7.30am and taken on the 1 hour drive to Siem Reap airport.  Our driver was so lovely and the time passed quickly as we were chatting to him. The Siem Reap airport is new as it had to get moved due to the old airport being to close to Angkor Wat and it was causing discolouration. The airport is quite nice but not overly used. We were through all the normal airport steps in a jiffy. I hope that we get to come back here soon as it was an amazing country full of amazing people.

We hopped in a grab with another guy who wanted to chat to Anthony about poltics, money and dodgy people and 20 minutes later we were at our accomodation. We checked in and then headed out to find some food. Last week when we were here Anthony wanted to go to Monster Curry which is the curry chain that replaces his favourite one in Singapore. It was actually really good.

We spent the night down by Gardens by the bay and watched Garden Rhapsody which is a free twice a night show down in the super tree grove. The show was fine just a normal light show. Anthony was not very impressed.

We decided to head back to our favourite resturant for dinner Kampong Glam Cafe it was great. Singapore was also such a great place to stop for the night.
