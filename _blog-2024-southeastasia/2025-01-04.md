After the busy day in Phnom Penh yesterday it was time to say goodbye and head towards Siem Reap. We were pretty excited as we loved Phnom Penh and everyone we had met said they loved Siem Reap more. 

We were packed and out early as we had to be on the bus at 8.45am to go across the country. We had decided to ride with a company called Giant Ibis and they were pretty good.

The ride was pretty uneventful we looked at the beautiful country side out the window. I was obsessed with the new style houses being built. They are all so colourful and cool. We made 2 stops, one was a toilet out stop and the other was for lunch. Anthony tried Beef Lok Lak which was pretty good. After 6 hours we arrived in Siem Reap.

When we arrived the hotel had organised a tuk tuk to pick up us and our bags. Anthony was very worried about the bags falling off but luckily it wasn't far and we arrived with no issues. The hotel is stunning it's beautifully done and we have 3 rooms in our hotel room.

We had a quick freshen up and then we decided to go to the Angkor National Museum to learn a little more about the history and the Khmer Empire it was really interesting walking around the museum and seeing parts of Angkor Wat that have been returned to the Cambodian people. The Khmer Empire had 4 great kings that were responsible for the majority of the Angkor wat complex and temples. The Khmer Empire was huge and actually took up most of what is now today Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. There is so much history here. The other important thing we learnt was about religion in Cambodia. The Khmer Empire was both Hindu and Buddhist and Angkor is a mix of those two religions. Nowadays the majority of Cambodia is just Buddhist.

After the museum we came back to the hotel for some dinner and went to bed early. We have a 4 am wake up call tomorrow.
