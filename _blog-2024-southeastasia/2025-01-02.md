Once per every trip you have a day where stuff just doesn't work. It's never just one things it's always a collection of things. Last year it was the trip to get to Sapporo, we have had the day the accommodation decided we didn't have a booking in New Zealand. But without fail during a trip there is always that one day. Today was that day.

Plan 1- Stay on the ship as long as we could.
We had to be out of the staterooms at 8 which was fine. However we planned to chill on the ship for a little longer, somehow we ended up getting corralled off the ship. 

Plan 2- Visit the fanciest airport in the world the jewel.
We had planned to spend the day at the jewel as we heard there was heaps to do. Which there is but what they don't tell you is you cannot do the majority of it with any luggage including carry on which means you need to store them at $16 an item. This was super annoying and we decided we would try to do the cool stuff after we had checked in our bigger bags. We did get to see the biggest man made waterfall which was pretty cool.

Plan 3- check our bags in for early check in.
This is where things went worse. We lined up for ages for early check in only to be told they wouldn't let us check in as we didn't have enough us dollars on us. We said why would we need more. Which the response was "Cambodia has no ATMs". I was shocked and brought up Google and showed him the ATMs in Cambodia and we were still told no. We went to change some more of our money into USD and just said we had enough but this was so stressful and had me worrying if I had made a mistake in deciding to go to Cambodia. It also wasted 2 hours of time for something that didn't need to happen and was really stressful

We just decided to wait for the plane and get some lunch. At 5pm we boarded our flight and made our way to Phnom Penh where we landed in our 15th Country Cambodia. I had all the paper work done so it was an easy airport to get through and before we knew it our driver was picking us up and we were on our way to our accommodation.

Cambodia is seriously being redeveloped it's crazy. So many new buildings and houses. Our taxi driver said 5 years ago the drive from the airport was past rice fields but not any more. We arrived at our hotel and man oh man we knew it was going to be good but it was so fancy and it was $100 AUD a night. Anthony's face was pretty funny. We settled in and then went for a walk to the conscience store. I felt super safe in this city which let me tell you does not happen everywhere. I am excited to go sightseeing tomorrow!
