Merry Christmas everyone. For us today it was a travel day with a couple of extra surprises for ourselves for Christmas.

We left super early from Bali and was picked up by our driver and driven to the airport. It was and had been pouring so it was a very scary drive. Parts of Bali were flooded and we had to drive through a lot of water. But no stress we made it in one piece and made quick work getting through the airport and into a cafe to have a coffee.

We got upgraded to Scoot plus so our seat was a little comfier on the plane. Otherwise it was a quick 2 hour and 30 min flight over to Singapore.

Singapore airport held up to its reputation for being the best and ran like clock work. We were through immigration in under 2 minutes. Happy to be back in a country we just adore we jumped in a grab and made out way to check into our hotel.

We rested up and only ventured out to get drinks when Anthony saw his favourite Jerky shop, so of course we stopped there.

We had planned to go to one of our favourite restaurants for Christmas dinner which is also in my favourite part of Singapore.  Kampong Glam cafe in the Arab Quarter. We made our way there and got a table and got some Maggi goreng noodles and I got the lime drink I love. It was just as good and just as cheap as the last time.  I was so happy just being back here.

We went for a walk around the area and got to see the beautiful Sultan Mosque and all the new art that is around now.

From dinner we went to our night tour. Untamed Paths run a couple of different tours to promote the local native animals in Singapore. They are a really cool company and if you are ever in Singapore  you should check them out. Tonight we were doing the Flight of the Colugos tour. We were met by our guide Noelle who took us on a walk through the Bukit Batok Nature Park. Our main goal of tonight was to find the Colugo. I did not know this was even an animal before I found this tour. It is also called the Sunda flying lemur or the Malayan flying lemur. They are strange looking creatures who do not fly but can glide between trees with their strange wings. We headed into the park armed with flashlights and a sense of adventure.  Our guide Noelle had literally the most amazing eyes and thought the night we saw about 10 different Colugos including a baby one.

We also say so many bugs, tarantulas, spiders and mini wildlife. It was amazing. Noelle was excited to spot (I don't know how she saw it) a green crested lizard sleeping in the tree. Apparently these are pretty rare which was cool to see but I did not get a good photo of it. The strangest thing we saw was the local wild chickens that roost in the tree tops in the jungle. The walk was so humid but so worth it. It was an amazing experience to get to see the wild side of Singapore.

After the tour we were waiting for a grab when a local lady came to talk to us. So excited to ask us if we saw the Colugo as she loves when tourists come to see them. She also told us about how sometimes when she walks here at night she sees a pangolin. 

I am so happy to be back in Singapore.
