We made some last minute changes today as we were meant to be going to the bird park. However both of us just were not feeling it. We decided to change our plans to head down to Gardens by the Bay.

We decided to start with breakfast at a Hawker Centre. We are staying very close to Old Airport Road Hawker Centre so we wandered down there to get some food. We decided to get some chicken rice and pork rice and a coffee and tea. It was really good.

It was then a train ride to get to a station to see if we could get the money off our expired train cards. Short story the answer was no so we were back on our way.

We arrived at Bayfront Station and headed to our first activity for today which is Floral Fantasy. Floral fantasy features large-scale topiary, floral sculptures and tropical plants normally with a theme in them. The theme changes fairly often. Luckily for me a new theme just opened up which is Disney. It was pretty amazing seeing how clever people are to make these huge statues with heaps of dyed flowers. My favourite bit is in the middle of Floral Fantasy there was a water section and a huge tank with poison dart frogs. They were so bright and amazing. We spent a bit of time here just watching them.

The last part of Floral Fantasy was a selection of floral arrangements showing some of Singapore's most popular foods. They were pretty cool too.

After Floral Fantasy we jumped on the shuttle bus which was included in our ticket and we headed over to the cloud forest. We had been here 6 years ago but wanted to go again as it was so cool last time. For those that don't know the cloud forest is a huge dome that is home to the to one of the worldâ€™s tallest indoor waterfalls and a lush mountain clad with plants from around the world. It's temperature is amazing after being in the humidity and it is just such a peaceful place even when filled with tourists. We spent a long time is here enjoying the cool air and looking at all the plants. They had an amazing orchid section from the Philippines along the back.  It was a great way to get out of the main heat of the day.

After a lot of walking (already up to over 7km at this point) we headed down towards Satay by the Bay for a late lunch. Anth was in charge of food ordering and I was in charge of drinks. When we met back up we had Pork Belly satay sticks, carrot cake (in Singapore this is not a desert nor does it have carrot. It's a delicious turnip stir-fry dish) and Mango sticky rice. I got us 2 pineapple and Rambutan sodas. The pineapple pieces were inside the Rambutans. All of the food was a little more expensive here but it was delicious. We had booked to go up Marina Bay sands tonight so we decided to do a quick grab ride back to the hotel to rest and charge our phones.

After a quick rest it was back to Bayfront station to go up to the top to Marina Bay Sands Sky Park. The view up here was pretty cool though the price is crazy. If you are not sure what Marina Bay Sands is its the biggest building in Singapore  and that has an infinity pool on top of it. We timed it right to get up while it was still light but not too far from sunset. It was super relaxing standing up the top watching the sun disappear and the colours change.

Last stop was of course to Coco Ichibanya as Anthony wanted curry. It is one of his favourite places.
