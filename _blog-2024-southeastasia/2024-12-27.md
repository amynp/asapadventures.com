Today we had 2 big activites planned so we didn't have to think too much. We started the day by heading down to breakfast at the hawker stalls again. Today we changed up what we got and ended up with a famous noodle dish and a kava bun, plus of course a tea and coffee. I really like this hawker stalls at Old Airport Road as it feels much more local. 

We hopped on a double decker bus to get us to Harbour Front station which was actually a really cool way to get around. We got. A great little tour of the city from the second story of the bus. Anthony played Pokemon most of the journey so I don't think he got to enjoy the views. Apparently he says he saw buildings. When we arrived at Harbour Front we jumped onto the Sentosa express which was packed! Finally we arrived and headed to our first activity of the day which was Harry Potter : Visions of magic.

Harry Potter Visions of magic only opened a week or 2 ago and is new. It was described as a unique experience with ten immersive environments, out of which, two are exclusive to Singapore. We didn't have huge hopes it would be good as we did the Harry Potter studio tour at the start of this year which was amazing but it was actually excellent. You are given and interactive wand for the experience which during your time will interact with the environments and lights.

You enter into the knight bus. That famous bus which really makes no sense in a magically adept world but here we are. The bus itself is cool. The beds move and shake and it  appears that the world is flashing on by. As this was the first room and people hadn't spread out it was hard to get photos in here. 

Next we arrived in 12 Grimmauld place- The House of Black. In this room the wants illuminate the portraits of the members of the black family on the walls as well as some hidden art. There is also an interactive fire place here too.

After Grimmauld Place you arrive in the Ministry of Magic. The cool thing here is every 3 minutes the whole ministry changes to a different Ministry. We saw the normal London one, the French one and a ministry in New York.  There are heaps of spots on the walls where you can wave your wand and make different effects.. The coolest one was if you go into the telephone booth and dial MAGIC the telephone box lights up and you hear a voice over the phone. It was awesome.

The Hall of Prophecy was probably my favourite in the whole place. The mirrors made it look like it went on for ages. You could wave your wand at different prophecies to activate them and they would tell you what the prophecy was. So cool!

The next room was a Singapore exclusive and it was the chamber of secrets. The chamber opens properly and then you are in the chamber. Creepy noises and giant snakes are included.

Newts menagerie and Knockturn alley were awesomeness to walk through and interact with. Then it was the room of requirement that heaps of Easter eggs from the films in it. So so cool.

The trap door was another Singapore exclusive and you sneak past fluffy and then go through some the the trials.. The key room was absolutely beautiful.

It was such a great interactive experience and well worth the visit. I hope it ends up travelling around because it is only in Singapore for a limited time.

We stopped by Beard Papa on the way back to the hotel and then rested until our night tour.

We had booked another tour with The Untamed Paths this time the Mangrove Rambling one. Luckily for us we had Noelle again and were the only ones on the tour. She walked us through the Mangroves at Pasir Ris Park. This place was seriously pitch black a very different feel from the other night. We explores the mangroves and started with a Oriental While snake (we saw 3 of these). We saw crabs, eels, weaver ants,weird fish, dog faced water snakes, Malayan water monitor's and so many other cool things. Anthony really wanted to see a Shore Pit Viper and it wasn't looking good and then I spotted a little one in the tree. It was such a amazing tour and a great place if you ever wanted to get into herping.
