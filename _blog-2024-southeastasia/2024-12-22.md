We are off and travelling again this time with our first stop being to our 13th country of Indonesia.

First man I hate flying. We flew Virgin Airlines and they were not great.  However it was only a 5 and a half hour flight so we cannot complain too much. I was sitting next to a lovely lady named Deb and we got chatting this was her 9th time to Bali.

We spent the flight listening to the new Brandon Sanderson book and it went pretty fast. Before we knew it we were touching down in Bali.  We had a couple of issues getting through immigration and by we I mean just me. But we got through grabbed our bags and found out driver Widi who took us on a 80 minute drive out to our hotel in Ubud. There was such cool architecture and statues on the way here. Which Anthony missed as he was sleeping.

Very sleepy we arrived at our hotel and pretty much just fell into bed.
