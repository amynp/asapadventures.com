What a day to end South Korea on. After not being sure we were going we got on a tour for the DMZ. We had organised a tour with Koridoor Tours to got the DMZ and the JSA. Unfortunately because Rob booked late he was on a separate tour that did not go to the JSA. If you are unsure what those acronyms stand for the DMZ is the Demilitarized zone it is 4km stretch of land that divides the 2 Korean Nations. 2 km of it is North Korea and 2 km of it is South Korea's. It is one of the most militarized boarders in the world. The JSA is the joint security area and it is the border that North and South share. This is where all the meetings take place between the 2 Korea's and also where lots of deaths and breakouts of violence have happened. The last piece of history I will tell you here is that The Korea's were divided in 1945 after Japan invaded. South Korea was given to the UN and north Korea went under Soviet Rule. However in 1950 North Korea invaded the South and war went on for 3 years. Even to this day the war although an amnesty in 1953 was reached the countries are still at war. Anyway now that that bit of history is done I will tell you about the tour.

We arrived at the Koridoor office at 7:30 and signed our lives away for the tour. We were then loaded onto the bus and driven an hour up to the DMZ. Scarily the DMZ is only 1 hours drive away from Seoul. We could see into North Korea from a few places along the drive.

Our first stop on the tour was to Dorasan Station. Dora station was built 15 years ago in the hope of travel between the two countries. It was used for a little while to take mateirals to the Kaesong Industrial Zone but ended up being closed down in 2008 when North Korea closed the crossing. It is seen as not the last station from Seoul but the first station to Pyeongyang. It was eerily quiet. There was also some gifts from Germany at the station because Germany has been in the same position they gifted part of the Berlin Wall. It was cool to look around and see everything.

After touring the station we loaded back in the bus and headed for the JSA. There was a lot of security checks. Then we joined took the bus into Camp Bonifas which is a United Nations Command military post located 400 meters south of the southern boundary of the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Here we met Private First Class Yates and Private Wilson who would be out military guides and security for visiting the JSA. We watched a video with the history of the DMZ and then signed waivers stating that we understood we were going into an active military zone. We then boarded a military bus and headed into the JSA. They have started to cut back on security at the JSA due to the peace talks between North and South. We got to look at the border and the buildings that sit over the North and South sides. North Korea also had a tour going over on their side.

We then got to go in 2 straight lines into the conference rooms. These rooms sit across both North and South Korea. So naturally as soon as we were in I hopped across the microphone cord and found myself in North Korea. We had a few minutes to walk around the room and take some pictures in North Korea. It was very weird but cool. We were told the North and South Korea are always listening in the microphones.

It was then off to explore the JSA. We went to the blue bridge and saw where South Korean president Moon met Kim Jong-Un and had tea and discussed peaceful relations. We also saw the tree north and south planted together. It is amazing to see these small steps towards peace for the 2 countries.

Private first class Yates then took us through some of the incidents and history that have occurred at the DMZ. It was such a great place to see and visit and look at how they really are both trying to bring their countries back together.

The next stop was lunch which was alright and then we headed to the Third Tunnel of Aggression. The Third Tunnel of Aggression is one of four known tunnels under the border between North Korea and South Korea, extending south of Panmunjom. The walk down was super steep and long. In the tunnel you could see the dynamite blasts and the fake coal they painted on there. The tunnel is so low too you had to duck to get through. No photos were allowed in the tunnel.

The last stop of the tour was up to the Dora Observatory. From here you can see into North Korea. It was pretty cool you could see the Propaganda Village. We spent a bit of time looking up here and then it was back on the bus to Seoul.
