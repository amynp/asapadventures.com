It was a very quiet day today as we only had a few simple plans. The morning Anthony and I spent shopping for kitchen knives. This turned out to be quite simple. We found the ones we liked straight away. We stopped for lunch at Gogo curry. Then met the others to go shopping at Nakano Broadway.

We bought a few things here and Dani got heaps of amiboos which was cool. We also saw the cutest little Shiba puppies.

In the afternoon i joined up with Karen to explore the streets of Asakusa. We then all met up for one last dinner together. We had Okonomyaki and it was great. I don't want to leave tomorrow :(
