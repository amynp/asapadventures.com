Last Morning of the trip. When we got up Brad and Alysha and Drew and Dani were already at the airport. We were leaving with the others a little later. We went to get an early Melon Bread for breakfast and then headed back to finish packing. At 11 we took the train with a bit of getting lost to the airport and then had to say Goodbye to Lobada! I will miss him so much. Then it was a very uneventful flight back to Melbourne with a stop in Taipei and HongKong.

The Trip:

It has been a crazy few weeks. We have covered 2 countries. Over 15 cities and according to Dani walked over 210km. We have traveled with many different groups and people and each experience has been wonderful. I am thankful to have so many wonderful people in my life. I am not keen to attempt to organise this many people again but I am glad it all went smoothly.

South Korea:
South Korea was such a stunning country. We traveled North and South although we could have spent so much longer in each. The city has an amazing public transport system. Lots of people willing to speak English to you and a grittiness which I adore. I hope to get back here to explore more one day.

My favourite things in South Korea in no order were:

-The DMZ

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/20190920103100_IMG_1516-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

This was a day full of so many emotions. There were times like standing on the empty Dora-san station looking at the Berlin wall the were eerie. Other times where we were face to face with North Korea surrounded by military that was scary. But overall it was awe inspiring and the knowledge history and information we got will make this a day I will not forget. Our military guides around the DMZ were amazing and I know they are both active soldiers but I feel they have found his calling in doing tours. I didn't feel the information we were getting was one sided or propaganda. Also standing in North Korea for a few minutes was not an experience I will probably ever get to do again.

-Gamcheon Culture Village

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/20190916173813_IMG_0856-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

This little village in Busan was stunning. It is another example about how people when working together can make something that was not great into one of the most interesting places to visit. This area use to be the slums but the villages got together to paint the houses install art work and bring this area to life. There is cool art work everywhere and lots of tiny alley ways to get lost in. The cafes and shop are so cute as well. I wasn't actually too keen on visiting here but I am so glad I did. I could have spent days exploring every nook and cranny of Gamcheon. Or possible just staring at the beautiful view of the houses. Next time I go here I will complete the stamp scavenger hunt around the village.

- Gyeongbokgung Palace
<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_0181-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

The main palace of Seoul and stunningly beautiful. We spent hours traversing this place. It is rich in culture and beautiful. The changing of the guards was loud, colourful and so precise. They blew conchs and banged drums. I think this was the first time I fell in love with Seoul it has embedded its old and new culture together so easily.

-The island of Jeju

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/20190918113046_IMG_1285-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

This little island was amazing. I think the highlight was the little old Jeju man that invited us into his home and told us all the history. But the rest of the island is just as beautiful. We had the most amazing lunch and our guide was amazing. The hike up Sunrise Peak was hard but the view was beautiful. Jeju was definitely a highlight.

-Taekwondo

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_0471-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

The elite team in South Korea were amazing to watch the show was one of the best things i have seen. The skill these guys had was unbelievable.

Japan

This was our 4th time back and I still love it as much. One day I will live here as it really does feel like home. The trip was amazing. The wedding we went for was amazing. It was nice to swap around people in groups. Tokyo was it crazy crazy self. I fell more in love with Osaka and its food and Kyoto has the most beautiful little towns all around it. The countryside in Japan is my favourite part of Japan. I swear I will be back to live here at some point.

My favourite things in Japan in no order were:

-Uji

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_1744-COLLAGE.jpg blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_0471-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

This was the beautiful town I have seen. The temple was stunning the street filled with Green Tea sweets was delicious and the river views were relaxing. This quickly became one of my favourite towns in Japan. It is right near Wazuka which is my other favourite town.

-Miyajima

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_2038-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

This was my favourite place last time and it was again this time. The island is beautiful with temples, beaches and deers. We also got to see the sunsetting over the island. I could go to this place every day and eat fried maple cakes.

-Disneyland and Sea Foods

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_20190930_143203-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

Oh wow! The food here was the best. Expensive but the best stuff I have had.

- Kobe Beef

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_2507-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

Again the most amazing beef I have ever had!! The show with the Kobe is just as amazing.

- The Wedding

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2019koreajapan/2019-10-03/IMG_20190925_144839_1-COLLAGE.jpg"/></div>

Watching your best friend get married is an amazing experience. It was such a beautiful day and everything was just perfect. I am so excited to watch them start their married life together.
