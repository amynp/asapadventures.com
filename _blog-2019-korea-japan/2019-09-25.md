What a day! It was long and I am exhausted but I haven't been this happy and tired from laughing in a long time.

Today was Drew and Dani's wedding and what a wedding it was. Lobada performed the ceremony and everything was just perfect. It was a great day with great friends. I am not sharing anything else as it is not my day to write about.

But a big congratulations to Mr and Mrs Coleman. I love you both so much.
Dani's blog has more info if you want to check it out or see pics of the beautiful bride.
