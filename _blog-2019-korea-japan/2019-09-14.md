Today actually really happened over 2 days as we left Melbourne Airport at 11:45 last night. We all met at the airport first and grabbed some dinner at the pub before flying out. The first flight was 9 and a half hours to Hong Kong. The flight was as most flights were long and tiring. We all got bits and pieces of sleep. But mostly we arrived tired in Hong Kong at 6.25am.

When we arrived in Hong Kong to a beautiful sunset. When we arrived the ground staff informed us that we had been moved to an early flight so instead of the 2 hour layover we had 40 min to get to our next gate. However it turned out fine and we arrived in Korea earlier then we were expecting.

We organised our sim cards and went for a walk around. The first fried chicken place we saw in Korea was a KFC which was very disappointing.

We finally got to the hotel and had a shower and a rest before heading our to  explore downtown. We explored the street around our Accommodation. We are staying in Insadong which is the cutest little area. Got some fried chicken as well which was a nice first chaser.

We then headed to Jogyesa Temple which is a very large Buddhist  temple in Seoul. When we arrived there was a ceremony taking place. It was very cool to see. We stayed for a bit and took some photos.

Lastly we headed for Myeongdong to have some street food tonight. We had some amazing dishes.  We headed back to the hotel early to rest.
