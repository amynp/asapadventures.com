We slept so much. We were all so tired after Disney yesterday. Today Drew, Dani, Tim, Lobada, Anthony and I headed out to explore the temples of Tokyo. We started at Asakusa shrine which is a shrine I have been to a few times. We met this cute Japanese man who took a liking to us and that we were collecting Shrine Stamps. He talked to us for a while about the different religions and what they mean.

From the Shrine we headed to what is meant to be the best Melon Bread ever. Kagetsudo has been making Melon bread since 1945. OMG this was the most amazing melon bread ever!!!

We then headed for lunch. Anthony and I headed to Ichiran Ramen while the others headed to Coco curry. The ramen was amazing. The best I have ever had and we got to sit at a tiny booth. It was the best.

Meeting up with the others we headed to Zojoji temple. We havent been to Zojoji since our first Japan trip where we spent NYE here. It was so nice to go back to see it. We collected some more shrine stamps and then headed to another temple in the area. This had one of the oldest trees in Tokyo and was just a nice place to take in the quiet.

Back onto the train we headed to our last shrine for the day Meiji Shrine. This is such a beautiful lush and quiet escape from the craziness that is Tokyo. We had a look around the shine got our temple stamp and then was told the Shrine was closing.

Our last stop for the day was to Shibuya Crossing as Drew and Dani did not see this last trip. We got star bucks and took some time lapses of the crazy crossing. It is such a crazy crossing. We headed home got some rice bowls and crashed.
