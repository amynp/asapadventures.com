This will be a very quick blog as all we did was drive today. We drove from coober Pedy to Murray Bridge. We made a few quick stops but overall it was 9 hrs and 27 minutes of driving. Luckily we had good company and podcasts. We had a really nice dinner at the local pub to finish the day off.

Here are a few photos of our day
