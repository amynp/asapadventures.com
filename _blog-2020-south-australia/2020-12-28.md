We were up early to get to our kayak tour run by Dolphin Sanctuary Kayak Tours. We signed in got organised for the tour. We were meant to spend 3 hours out on the kayaks to explore the ship wrecks and the marine sanctuary as well as the mangroves. However we only ended up doing about half of the tour as 1 and a half hours in a cramped kayak was not good on Anth's legs or my back.

However what we got to see was amazing. The huge shipwrecks were very interesting to look at and we got to see plenty of dolphins in the sanctuary waters.

After we finished the tour we had a look around the docks and I did some photography of the birds.

We then headed back to the hotel to change (we were pretty wet) and booked into a Dolphin cruise to see other dolphins. The dolphins we kayaked with were Bottle nose dolphins, however the ones we would see on the cruise would be Port River dolphins.

The tour would leave from Port Adelaide so we headed down there. We grabbed some lunch and I had the most spicy chicken ever and then it was time to go on the cruise.

The cruise was amazing. We saw all of Port Adelaide and saw so many dolphins. 1 followed our boat the whole way back. The tour was only $12 and well worth the price.

We went for a walk around Port Adelaide and saw some of the old buildings before heading to the Adelaide Botanic gardens.

The botanic gardens were beautiful. They have heaps of different buildings with different themed areas. The amazon water lilies were amazing. There was also a rain forest area and desert area. Well worth the time.
