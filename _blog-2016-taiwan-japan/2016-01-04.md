Todays will be a short entry with no pictures because all we did today was swap countries.We packed early and left the hotel at 9, we had organised a van to pick us up. We got to the airport and sat patiently inline until check in opened up. Then it was a 12:45pm flight which arrived atOsaka at 4:30. We got through customs and immigration easily and then hoppedonto the train. Long story short it took us till 8:00 to get to the hotel becausethere had been an accident in the tunnel. We grabbed a quick bite for dinner and then headed to an arcade with the other group for the night. I managed to win a Yoshi for Dani and a statue forTim. It was then time to call it a night.
