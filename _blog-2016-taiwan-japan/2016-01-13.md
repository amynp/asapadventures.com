After a magical day at Disneyland yesterday we were off to the other theme park at Disney, Disney Sea. It was the same as traveling yesterday very crowded and three trains. Finally we arrived and jumped on the monorail. At the moment the Sweet Duffy event is happening at Disneysea and the monorails was themed appropriately. If you do not know who Duffy is he is the Disney bear and is huge in Tokyo. A couple of monorail stops later and we were at the park.

Disney Sea is a huge theme park aimed more towards adults and has themed ports instead of lands. It was built with no budget and due to this the park is so well themed it is scary. The 7 different ports at disneysea are:

Mediterranean Harbor - This part is based on Venice in Italy and has gondolas going through it. The canals wind around shops and buildings and all the building you can see are hotel rooms for the Miracosta hotel which is the only hotel located inside a park. The huge port in the centre looks out onto Mount Prometheus the huge volcano and is where the shows are located.

Mysterious Island- (My favourite) This land is set in the sides of Mount Prometheus. It is a steam punk area and based on Jules Verne's books, Journey to the Center of the Earth, 20000 league's under the sea and Vulcania.

Mermaid Lagoon- Where Ariel lives. The whole land here is themed for The little mermaid and is fully undercover. It looks like you are under the sea.

Arabian Coast- This is based off the movie Aladdin and is set as a harbor in Arabia. It is like you have stepped into Agrabah in the dessert.

Lost River Delta - This area is based off the jungle and AZTEC ruins. It is green and houses a huge temple.

Port Discovery- This area is known as the port of tomorrow. It is where new technologies are explored and invented and is themed for the future.

American Waterfront- This is based on the New York waterfront in the 1920's. It is a huge area and houses a life-size ship called the S.S Columbia. There are Broadway shows and the huge High tower hotel.

All of these lands are themed perfectly. It is really an amazing place to go. Our first stop for the day was to quickly head to American Waterfront where we grabbed some Fast Passes for Toy Story Mania. The line for this was sitting at 60 min and is the most popular ride of the park. We got fast passes but they were not until 9pm. We continued around to Lost River Delta and took some pictures in front of the amazing Aztec Temple.We had some couple shots and then someone had the bright idea to all get up on the podium. Most of us got up and were ready to take the picture until we heard the sound of Lobada tumbling off the podium. The lady taking our photo managed to capture the entire fall of Lobada including people trying to grab him. Poor Lobada!

We brushed Lobada off and keep going deciding to go onto Raging spirits. We somehow managed to convince Dani to go onto this roller coaster and after a short wait we were all racing through an old Aztec ruin on a roller coaster finishing with a 360 degree loop. I made me happy to see how much Dani was starting to enjoy rides.

After the ride we went in to explore Arabian Coast. The theming in this are is perfect. It feels like you have entered the desert and the shops and houses are themed. There are ceramics and pots around. The best way I could explain it is saying it was like Stepping into Aladdin. We went on Sinbads adventure here, this ride is a boat ride through the story of sinbad. The animatronics are pretty cool and the tiger in the story is so cute. We had Curry at the Market place in Arabia and then Anthony and I went to lose some carnival games. I mean to say lose because if you win you get a stuffed toy but if you lose you get to choose 1 of 5 pins. After playing 5 times and losing we had collected all 5 pins and it was time to move on.

Rob, Anthony and I went to find a locker and then headed to meet up with the others. We decided to meet up at Journey to the centre of the earth and most of us went on that ride. I rode with Dani and the look on her face when we shot out of the volcano was priceless. We went across and some of us rode Indiana Jones again. After this we decided to split up and Rob, Alysha, Brad, Anthony and I rushed across to American waterfront to go on Tower of Terror. The Tower of Terror was a 45min wait so we stood in the line. The line is the lines for the rides are so beautifully designed that you can stand in there and look around. In the tower of Terror you walk through Hightowers hotel full of all the treasures he has taken from around the world. The hotel is all dusty and small details were everywhere. The ride itself take you in an elevator to the top of hightower and then drops you straight down. Very cool ride.

We spent the rest of the night taking some photos before meeting up with the people that were left at the park. We had dinner at Cape Cod Cook off before racing off to ride some more rides. We rode 20000 leagues under the sea before it was time for Fantasmic. Fantasmic is the night show at DisneySea and was amazing. It had fireworks, villains, water streams, fire, boats with dancers on it really worth staying out in the cold for. We ran back to take Chris on Journey to the Center of the Earth. Chris enjoyed it just as much as Dani had which was very amusing.

At 9 o'clock we headed over to Toy Story mania. This ride was a 3D carnival game ride where you scoot around a track and play different games. Pretty fun. It was nearly park closing time so we headed back to the shops. We bought a few things and then Rob realised he left my toy Gelatoni on the ride. He raced back to find and I was not confident that it would be found. However Rob as normal managed to do the unthinkable and returned with Gelatoni in hand. AMAZING!!

It was such a fun day and we got back to the hotel at nearly midnight.
