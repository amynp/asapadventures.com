Today was not only our last day in Japan but also our last day at Disneyland. So we were up early and headed to the parks. I was very excited to be heading back to Tokyo disneyland. We decided today that we would take it easy and explore the parks slowly. We started te day by going to the Guest Centre to get me a birthday badge as we decided we would celebrate my birthday early. They gave me one with my name in Englishand then then the lady gave me one with the Japanese version on my name. It was very cool.

We decided to find some breakfast so we headed into Fantasy Land. We jumped straight onto Snow White's scary adeventture. It was a pretty plain ride but it was still pretty fun. When we were done we found Captain Hook and Smee walking around. Anthony wanted a picture with Smee so we waited a bit and got a photo with him. We grabbed some breakfast and went off to explore the park. We rerode Star Tours and space mountain again. Then we got Green Alien Motchi. These were very cool sweets and came in 3 different flavours. They had chocolate, vanilla and strawberry filling.

We then decided to go and watch One mans dream which is a show in Tommorowland. I will say I was not overly impressed with this show. There were odd characters and the story didnt quite flow. After this we headed to Adventure land to get some pins. These pins were won by losing the carnival games in Adventure land. So after 8 attempts at losing we had finally gotten all the pins. It was late afternoon at this point so we decided to skip the parade and go and watch the glassblower instead. It was interesting watching him, the statues he was making were amaxing.

We decided to have a late lunch so that we could get into the Queen of Hearts banuet hall. This resturant was worth the late lunch. The theming is amazing in here. You walk in through the Door Knob and are greated by rows of playign cards. We got a steak meal which was delicious.

As it was approaching the end of the day we headed into Toontown. We went straight to Rodger Rabbits Toontown Spin. As we lined up the ride broke down and everyone left. We thought we would hang around for a while and very soon the ride reopened and we were able to walk on. It was short but fun. When we got out we were able to get pictures with Carabelle Cow and Horace Horsecollar. Then we saw Donald Duck so naturally we had to get a photo with him. We only had time to do one more thing so we decided to get an engagement photo with Mickey Mouse. After waiting 30min we got our picture. We then had to leave to meet the others for dinner.

We all met for our last meal and the closest Japanese resturant and scraped our money togetherfor food. I am going to miss Japan so much it has been an amazing journey through the country and we have travelled with amazing people.
