We had a slower start this morning while we stuffed around in the accomodation trying to get some washing done. It was a bit later in the afternoon when we got moving. We headed into the city and went for a bit of a stroll down the waterfront and Salamanca Place. We called into a few shops and just had a browse. We had lunch at a sushi train which was pretty good and then it was time for our first tour.

We had booked to go on the Mount Wellington explorer. When the weather is bad or there is snow they shut the road to Mt Wellington and this is the only way up. They pick you up from down near the harbour and then its a 2 hour 15 min tour around the area. Christan our guide advised us when we got on the bus that it was currently -16 degrees on the mountain with 80 km winds. But he wasn't concerned at all. We headed up the mountain and were welcomed with some stunning views when the clouds cleared. Up the top we were lucky to get some good views of hobart before the snow and wind picked up. It was very but also such a great afternoon up in the snow. I would really reccommend this tour.

After the tour we were quickly went back on the road to make it to our night tour at Bonorong Wildife Park, This turned out to be one of the best tours I have ever done. Robyn our guide only had me and Anthony on her tour so we pretty much just followed her around while we fed and played with the animals. Robyn was amazing to listen too she is so passionate and had the most amazing stories. The sanctury itself is the only wildlife hospital in Tasmania. They are home to animals that cannot be released to the wild. Some animals in the sanctuary are blind, missing limbs and a possum was missing both of her front hands. They are so cared for here though it is lovely. We started with a little echidna and got to hand feed him. He was missing one of his feet. We also got to give him Pat's. We then fed Forrester kangaroos, tawny frogmouths, spotted qualls, Tassie devils, ringtail possums, eastern quolls, sugar gliders and we got to hug the cutest little wombat ever. It was just a really great tour. If you are ever in the area you need to go.
