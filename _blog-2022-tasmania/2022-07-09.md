Today we didn't have a whole lot to do. Our main stop was to the Salamanca Market's. These markets are really awesome they have heaps of things for sale they have foods from around the world, crafts, woodturning items and just about anything you can think of.

The afternoon was spent driving back to Launceston. We made a quick stop at the 2 old bridges in Richmond and Ross. While we drove we ate the fresh honeycomb we got from Salamanca it was delicious.

We checked into the cabin and unpacked everything from the campervan so we could pack it properly for tomorrow.

We then chilled until having dinner at Grindlewald.
