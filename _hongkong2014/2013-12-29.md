After a late night last night we decided to skip breakfast at the zoo. We got ourselves motivated and walked to the Hotel Rendezvous to catch the express bus to Singapore Zoo. The bus ride was nice as it meant we could relax our sore legs.

We arrived at Singapore Zoo at about 11o'clock and the amount of people there was very very scary. The new boat ride at River Safari was already fully booked out for the day. We joined an extremely long line to buy tickets and then Anthony saw a sign which saved the day. Anthony bought our tickets online on his phone and we were able to get out of the line and use his phone for entry. He is a genius!

I wanted to go to the river safari first so we set off with the rest of Singapore to the River Safari.

Anthony was hungry and I wanted panda bean buns so we made our way to Mama Bears cafe. On the way we had a quick look at some of the attractions. We made it to the cafe and joined a long line to get food. The line was ridiculous. We ordered 2 panda buns, one chocolate and red bean (they were sooo cute), Chicken Chop Ramen with Mango Pudding, Shanghai Wonton Ramen with Mango Pudding, Fruit Salad and 2 ice teas. We faced a huge problem when we had our food, there was nowhere to sit. The Chinese tourists were like vultures and stalking people til they left. Luckily for us a nice local (Anth: who we shall call good guy Greg) Let us sit with him while his wife and daughter were in the long queue. The meal wasn't to bad and it was so cute.

After breakfast/lunch we headed to see the rest of the River Safari. The scenery around the Safari is beautiful and they use the natural beauty of the land well. We walked straight past the pandas and the line was dreadful. River Safari has 7 of the main rivers of display, they have The Amazon, The Ganges, The Nile, The Mekong, The Congo, The Yangtze  and our very own Murray River. Each area has some creatures on display that rely on the river. We saw crocodiles, fish (some were bigger then my head), beavers and many more. 

The Amazon part was my favourite. We got to see Giant River otters and some Manatees. We sat and watched the Manatees for a while they are amazing and relaxing creature. The Manatees were Anthony's favourite as well. They also had Squirrel Monkey forest  which allows you to walk through the squirrel monkeys enclosure. This was cool as the monkeys were running above your head.

We had bought a 2 zoo pass and decided it was time to use the 2nd zoo. So we made our way to Singapore Zoo. We had a quick browse through the Frozen Tundra exhibit. We then took the tram on a tour of the zoo. We were able to see many animals from the tram. 

It was 4 o'clock when we finished on the tram so we grabbed some ice tea and made our way to the polar bear feeding. The Polar bear named Inuka was the first polar bear to be born in the tropics and he is now 23 years old. He put on a bit of a show while feeding and he was beautiful. Did you know that polar bears have translucent fur and black skin. I didn't but Anthony did, he is a smart arse.

We were very tired after this and decided to go home. We made it just in time to get the bus and made our way back to the hotel. The bus driver (Anth: Barry) was a lunatic. I was just happy to make it back. 

We rested for a while and then headed out for dinner. On the way Anthony found the famous Jerky shop near our hotel and was so excited. Anthony bought some Jerky but not nearly as much as the guy before him who spent $863 on Jerky.

We had dinner in a complex that sold a variety of food from dodgy little stalls. I love the feel of these places and the food is always cheap and yummy, even if sometimes the place looks dodgy. We have had a good day, though have had enough of crowds to last us a life time.
