Luckily for us our hotel had a really late check-out. So we were able to sleep in and pack our bags slowly. We ducked down to starbucks again and then headed to the airport.

It was a pretty uneventful day. We got on a plane. Read some books are some food. Anthony actually got the cutest little Bento box on the flight. Then finally arrived in Tokyo.

However the lines at immigration were crazy. It took us over an hour to get through I have no idea what was going on but it was terrible. I feel like this has been the same on every arrival in Tokyo.

We did a quick stop at 7/11 to get some food, we ate it and then jumped on a train to our accommodation. It took about an hour to get into Tokyo but it was pretty easy. We only had to swap one train. Luckily we know how the trains work here so we didn't have to stop and get special tickets or anything.

We checked into our hotel which is the robot hotel in Asakusa-bashi. It is down these cute little alleyways only 200m from the station. The robot lady checked us in which was super easy and before we knew it we were up in our room. It was super late but we thought we would head out to get some food and we are in a great location.

We headed to a late night restaurant and ordered some food from the ticket machine outside. It was very delicious. I know its not a very exciting blog but it is really late and need to sleep. But I am so happy to be back in Japan.
