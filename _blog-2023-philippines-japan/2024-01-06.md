After being on our feet for nearly 14 hours yesterday at Universal studios we were feeling a bit tired and sore today. Luckily we only had lunch in Kobe today which I think was the thing Anthony was looking forward to most.This will be the third time we have headed back to Steak Ayoma which is a Kobe Steak resturant in the town of Kobe about 40 min from Osaka. The beef is beyond comparison but also it a family run resturant and the chef is really delightful.  

Apparently since we were last there they have become super popular and you have to normally book months in advance now which is good for them as covid was very tricky with limited tourists in Japan. We arrived on time and Anthony was very excited. We ended up having lunch with 2 other couples. 1 couple from Singapore and 1 couple from the Phillipines which turned out really lovely as we got to chat about our holidays, lives and trade Japan tips. It was really nice.

As normal the food was amazing. You get three courses and you get to choose bread or rice with your meal. My advice is choose the bread as it gets cooked in the steak juices. If you don't know about Kobe Beef here is a quick description: Kobe beef is a type of high-quality beef that comes from the Tajima strain of Wagyu cattle. They are raised and fattened under strict conditions in the Hyogo prefecture of Japan. Kobe beef is renowned for its tenderness, marbling, and flavor, and is considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. It is also the reason it is so pricey. We had an absolutley delightful lunch.

The rest of the day we spent walking around Osaka and picking up a few things for people that had asked and stuff for us. We are so sad to be leaving and I currently have a huge list of things to do next time in Japan. We had our last dinner at Yoshinoya and then watched some youtube and chilled in the hotel.
