Well here we are excited to be in Japan again after a long flight to get here. We left Melbourne at 10pm on Wednesday which is where this blog will start from.

We met up at the airport and found checkin was very easy and efficient. Excited we headed to Nandos to grab some dinner. We had plenty of time to relax which was a nice way to start the trip. Our first flight was to Taipei.

It was a long overnight flight. We all tried to sleep with little sucess and arrived into Taipei at 6am local time. We did get to see the sunrise from the plane though which was nice.

We had  short stop over at Taipei airport in where we got to go for a walk around and a stretch before we were on another plane heading to Osaka. This trip was less painful and before we knew it we arrived. 

Kansai airport was running very smoothly which was suprising as only 2 weeks ago it was mostly underwater due to Typhoon Jebi. The airport is fully operational now. They are trying to promote Tourism again after the Typhoon so when we entered arrivals we were greeted by these lovely ladies handing out gifts. I got a geisha set of nail clippers. 

We organised our money, found a pokemon shop at the airport and very tired as it was now 1pm with little sleep found our way into the city and to our hotel. On the train ride in we noticed that a lot of houses still had damage to their roof tiles and had lots of tarps on there houses.
We settled in and showered and then decided to go on an adventure into Den Den Town.

Den Den town is the electronic and Anime district in Osaka. There are so many shops and maid cafes around. It was an interesting place to spend a few hours exploring.

We stopped at BIC Camera to pick up some data cards and then headed to Dontonbori for dinner. We missed out on getting to Dontonbori last time we were here but it was amazing. It is so bright and busy and the food was to die for. Anthony ate Chargrilled crab which he said was amazing. We had the best Gyoza I have ever tasted. Our next stop we heard the siren song of the no1 Tatoyaki place in Osaka. So we lined up there and OMG they were amazing too. Yes, the Takoyaki place has its own song. We ate our way down the street happily. It was amazing.

Our food journey took us down to the river where we went for a stroll. We checked out Don Quiote and took in the beauty of the river. However we decided to call it a night as we were all a bit tired.

I better sign off as I have had 30 minutes sleep in the past 36 hours. I am so grateful to back in this beautiful country though and am very excited to explore the next few days.
