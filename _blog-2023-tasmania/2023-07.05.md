We arrived in Hobart late last night and settled into our beautiful hotel in Salamanca Place.

This morning we got some coffee and then drove about an hour and 15min to Pirate Bay. The driving around Tasmania is just beautiful we passed so many water ways and bridges. We even got to see on of the bridges move out of the road so that boats could pass through.

We had booked a cruise on Wild Ocean Tasmania . It's a small boat that takes you down the Tasman Peninsula. It was absolutely stunning. Our boat driver took us underneath the Tasman Arch and the devils kitchen and then we went down the coast right to the end of the South East of Tasmania. The cliffs here are so huge the photos do not show how big they are. We stopped to see some seals eating jumping tuna and lounging on the rocks. We also got to see some Albatross flying around. They are very graceful birds.

After the great cruise we headed down towards the tessellated pavement. This is a section of beach that have tessellated rocks. They call them pans and loafs and its all natural formation with cracks in the rocks. We walked along the rocks for a bit and then decided to go get lunch,

We headed down to a tavern called The Fox and the hound. It was this cute little english looking tavern down near Port Arthur. The food was really good.

It was a long drive back to Hobart so we got started and made it back to Hobart by 4. On the way back we saw 2 loose chickens and a few tassie devil signs with wings.
Tonight we headed out for Anthonys birthday dinner. We went to The Drunken Admiral. The resturant was so well themed. It is all pirate and ship themed and we had our own tiny ship to have dinner in. Not only was it well themed but the food was delicious too.

On the way back to the hotel we saw a seal in the harbour which was pretty cool.
