We were up early and packed from our accomodation in Hobart. We had decided to head South of Hobart for a detour to do a tour at Raptor Refuge down in Kettering. The centre is a rehab and hospital for injured raptors and birds of prey. You can only see the place by booking a private tour.

We were greeted at the gate and taken around the centre we got to see so many of the rescued raptors. We saw Masked Owls, Wedgetail Eagles, Gossier Hawks, Sea Eagles, Falcons and a few more. We heard all their stories and spent time watching them. We also got to go into the education centre and see some of the wings and models of the birds.

After raptor refuge we started to drive to Bicheno. It was such a beautiful drive. We stopped in Ordford for lunch and had a quick look around the little town.

Back on the road we made another stop at Spiky bridge which is just a cool old bridge.

We then arrived at the accomodation which has the most beautiful view. We hung around for a bit before hitting the private beach to try and see some penguins. Unfortunetly we didnt see any tonight but we heard heaps of them. We also saw a wombat on the way back.
