Today was hot!! We started out early and our first pitstop of the day was for The National Mint. Entry to here is free. There was a shop at the bottom which sells the limited edition coins and there is also an area where you can mint your own coin. The museum in the mint was fasinating as it showed the development of coins in Australia. Man we have had a lot of change in what we use for money. We spent about 2 hours walking through the whole thing.

We then headed back to China Town to head to a Korean Restaurant. The food was really good.

It was then off the the Australian War Memorial. I knew from my Aunty Maureen that I had a few relatives names that were on the War Memorial. So we placed some poppies on their names. The War Memorial was very pretty but also very depressing. We finished up there and decided to call it a day as it was sooo hot. Canberra is a very nice city to visit though.
