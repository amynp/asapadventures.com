Today we were starting our mini road trip. We were heading North to Canberra. The drive was expected to take 6 and a half hours. 
We took it in turns driving and decided our first stop should be a quick stop in Glenrowan to see where Ned kelly had his last stand. The town was cute and we got to pat a horse too.

Our next stop was to Beechworth where we dropped in to see my friend Ali. She made us the most beautiful Pad Thai. We got to see where she grew up and her house which was lovely. Unfortunatly we couldnt stay long. We soon were back on the way to Canberra. With a quick stop at the SUBMARINE? I am not sure why there is a submarine in the country.

We arrived in Canberra at about 7pm. Settled in and grabbed some dinner. We then made our way to Telstra Tower. We had to drive right up a mountain to get there, which was quite cool. The views from Telstra tower were really cool. Very nice to see the sun going down.
Nice way to end a day full of travel.
