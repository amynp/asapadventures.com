The town of Uji -

Uji is a small city in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, famous for its rich history, beautiful nature, and role in Japanese tea culture. It’s best known for being one of the main regions where high-quality green tea, particularly matcha, is grown.  Uji is also famously linked to The Tale of Genji, one of Japan’s most famous classical works of literature. The story, written by the nobleman Murasaki Shikibu in the 11th century, is often considered the world’s first novel.
The town is surrounded by rivers and is also home to cormorant fishing or ushi fishing. This practice, which dates back over a thousand years, involves trained cormorant birds used to catch fish in the Uji River.

Fushimi Sake River Cruise- The Fushimi Sake Boat Ride is a unique and enjoyable experience in the Fushimi district of Kyoto, which is famous for its sake production. While not directly in Uji, it’s relatively close, and it combines a bit of history with a scenic boat ride along the picturesque canals of Fushimi.The canals in Fushimi were historically used to transport water to the sake breweries, so the boat ride offers a way to see the traditional kura (sake storage buildings).
