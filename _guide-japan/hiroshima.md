Even though Hiroshima and Miyajima are a long day trip from Japan it is one worth doing. A day to these places shows amazing history, culture and scenery which is nearly unrivilled in Japan. With a bit of planning and organisation a day trip here is more then doable.

        You will need to start your day early with a JR Rail Pass. The cost of Osaka to Hiroshima is about $108 AUD without the pass. We caught a 7:18 train from Shin Osaka station which arrived in hiroshima at around 9.05. If possible reserve a seat on the Shinkasen a day or two before.The train is an easy ride and you can order food on board.

        When you arrive at Hiroshima walk out to the bus stops. Take bus number 2 or number 6 for about 13 minutes and get off at Genbaku Dome-Mae Station. The cost of the bus will be ¥180. The first stop is a 3 min walk and is The Atomic Bomb dome. This is where the Atomic Bomb was detonated. There are some signs around the building to explain what you are looking at.

        From the Atomic Bomb Dome head across the river. There are some beautiful statues and some great views along the river here. Just before the peace park is a bridge in which you can take great shots of Hiroshima and the Atomic Bomb Dome. Shows the old and new of Hiroshima.

        From the end of the bridge is the Hiroshima Peace Park. It is free to look around in here and it has a few memorials. The Kids Peace Park was a symbol of hope and it is where all the cranes that are sent to the park are kept in honor of Sadako Sasaki the little girl who wanted to make 1000 cranes before she died. This area also has the peace flame. You probably can see most of the things here in 30-40 minutes.

        Next head over the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. The Museum is open from 8:30am to 6pm everyday and costs ¥200. This Museum shows what happened during the bombings and the after effects of Radiation. From a history point of view it is a great museum however some of the things in the museum are hard to see and very upsetting. The Museum represents a very neutral view on the war and the bombings and is worth the visit.
