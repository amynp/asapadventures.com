We said goodbye to Katherine this morning and started out adventure to Kakadu. We started by getting a good old Mc Donalds breakfast. It was going to be a 3 hours drive from Katherine to Kakadu so off we took. After about 1 and a half hours we were entering Kakadu National Park. I was pretty excited to be here as I know my Grandad always wanted to come here. So I am glad I could get here.

We arrived at our Hotel The Mecure Crocodile Hotel and were a bit early to check in. We had a browse around and they have some amazing Aboriginal Art here. They have a huge gallery of all the local artists and offer a variety of art work and photography for sale.

Then it was time for our main attraction we left our bags at the hotel and drove down to the airport. We had booked a scenic flight over Kakadu. Our Captain was Cameron and he was amazing. He played Danger zone as we took off so we knew he had a great sense of humour. I have no words to describe how good the flight was. Amazing doesn't cover it. We went over Jim Jim Falls, Twin Falls, Cameron Falls, Double Fall and Hole in the Rock Falls. We flew over Kakadu and Arnhem land. The whole time we flew Cameron told us stories of the land, the dreaming and science. It was so interesting. 

The huge rock formation in the park is Burrunggui (Nourlangie Rock) and is said to be the resting place of one of the creation gods named Namarrkon or the lightning man. Cameron explained that often the storms do actually form right over these rocks so he understands the dreaming stories about them. After an hour it was all over and we had to get back to the ground.

Such an amazing experience.
We spent the rest of day relazing and had dinner at the resturant at the hotel.
