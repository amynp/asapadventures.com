Well i would love to say leaving Melbourne was easy and calm but that would be a lie. We had so many issues with the flight. It was delayed 2 hours. Then bought back to a 30 min delay. Then we got to the plane then there were not enough seats and they had to ask for volunteers to get off the plane. Anyway eventually we were in the air and flying. I cannot say that i missed flying very much and we made it into Darwin 3am Melbourne time,].
By the time we got through the border check and found a taxi we arrived at our hotel at 2.30am Darwin time or 4 am Melbourne. It was straight to bed for us. 

This morning we got up much later then normal and just took our time getting ready. We headed to the Coffee Club for breakfast and then started our exploring.

First stop was to the World War 2 Oil Tunnels. There are 2 oil tunnels that you can walk around in with lots of interesting information about the War. They built these tunnels underground so that the could move the oil in case their were bombings. Darwin was the main port of defense in WW2. However by all accounts the Aussies were not very clever with their oil tunnels and even though they were secret they left all the dirt dug out at the front of the tunnels. 

Darwin had more bombs dropped on it then Pearl HArbor which is not a fact I knew. The tunnels were interesting if not a weird tourist attraction. It was fairly cheap too.

Then we were onto Crocosaurus Cove. Which is a small crocodile center in the city. It was really cool. We got to spend a lot of time there watching crocodiles get fed. The crocs were huge and I mean crazy big. We looked at heaps of lizards and reptiles too and then got to feed the baby crocodiles. It was really good.
