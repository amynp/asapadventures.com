Today was a day at sea which meant the goals were to eat, relax and win the Disney trivia.

We woke up to beautiful views of the ocean and we did wake up quiet late. It's so nice to have a slow day after travelling pretty full on so far.  We got up had breakfast and coffee for Anthony and then we had to go and get an immigration ticket for tomorrow when we get to Okinawa. While we were there we got to meet Ricky in the flesh and got a picture with him. He is such a nice guy!

We then spent the day doing random things. We had to go to the casino so Anthony could collect more American quarters. He is trying to collect all the states. While we were there I got very invested in a Chinese family who were playing the coin game as she was trying to get the $10 note. I was watching and ooohing when it moved and the husband was laughing with me and gesturing about lucky moves and how his coins were the luckiest. It was so much fun and when it fell down we all let out a huge cheer and celebrated.

We got back to our room and our lovely room attendant Mark made me a towel duck! So cute! It was his first day back on the ship yesterday after a holiday break! I have a habit of talking to everyone which I hope doesn't annoy Anthony.

We went to hang in the music room to get ready for Disney Trivia. This one was songs from Disney.  You got one point for the name and one point for the movie. We got 29/30 and we got equal first. Stupid when you wish upon a star! We got some Royal Caribbean cups as the reward. Woo hoo!

We stopped for a quick lunch at the Pizza shop and ended up having a great view! I love cruise days. Also the pizza they do is great.

The afternoon we relaxed. I finished my book and we sat on the balcony.  For dinner I had booked the Steak House Chops Grille for Anthony. It was pretty amazing. We have now tried every speciality dining on the Of the Seas ships and they are all very good.

The show tonight was a Los Vegas burlesque show so we have that a miss!

Off to Okinawa tomorrow.
