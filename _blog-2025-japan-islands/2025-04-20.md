Having said goodbye to Japan this morning we made our way to the airport by taxi and boarded our flight to Hongkong. We flew Hong Kong express which were not great, but they are a budget airline and they did get us to Hong Kong. We had to fly back today as we have our cruise tomorrow. We made it to our hotel for the night which is actually in the best location and rested for a bit.

We headed out to In's Point which is a multistory shopping building that sells all sorts of memorabilia and little things. In the past we have bought some transformers from here but no luck today. It was still really cool to have a look around and buy some small knick knacks! We detoured to the jerky shop because of course Anthony got some jerky.

Then it was food time. We had some amazing Dim Sum at a very local resturant. It was so cheap too only $40 AUD for the two of us. We also got some egg waffles and gong cha before calling it a night. We are both pretty tired from doing washing until 1am last night!
