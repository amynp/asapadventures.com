Today was cruise day!!! So excited! We got this cruise on the Black Friday sales for under $1000 per person. Which is crazy cheap plus It was also going to Okinawa and Taiwan which is a pretty cool plan!

We grabbed an Uber from our hotel and before we knew it we were down at the port. Boarding and everything was so smooth we pretty much just walked right through all the procedures and then we were on The Ovation of the Seas. We did the Anthem of the seas in December and this is a pretty similar ship with just a few differences. First thing I noticed was the art was nicer on this ship.

We found a spot at the Windjammer which is the Buffet on board and grabbed some snacks and lunch.  It was getting more and more busy as everyone got on so after we finished eating we headed up to a quiet place we found last time on the ship which is the library which is hidden upstairs. We got some seats and relaxed until our state room was ready.

At 1 o'clock our room was open and we headed in to set up our stuff. To our suprise our bags were up here as well. Hong Kong is a very organised port! We set up all our cruise stuff and made the room extremely livable for the next few days. 

We went downstairs to grab some ice cream and some snacks and then headed back up to our balcony to watch us sail away past Hongkong and some islands. It was really pretty.

We spent a lot of time relaxing and reading and then it was already dinner time. We were happy to be back in the main dining room as the food is so good.

After dinner we explored the ship. It is a pretty cool ship with heaps of activites and areas.  Where Anthem of the Seas had a giraffe, Ovation of the seas has a Mum panda and a baby. So we made our way to the top deck to get a picture of the pandas.

The last thing of the night was the first Headline Entertainment. We got to see our Cruise Director Ricky from Jamaica whose videos we have seen and he is pretty hilarious! He welcomed us onboard Ovation of the Seas and introduced the first show which was Duo Eligra. They are a husband and wife circus and acrobatic duo from Russia and they were amazing. They mixed silks, acrobatics, hula hooping and many other skills. It was such a great show.

With that our first night on the cruise was done and we hit the hay.
