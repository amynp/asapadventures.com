We have a full day stop over in Hong Kong and of course I decided we should spend it at Disneyland. It is also our 8 year wedding anniversary today which is pretty cool. Normally I would under no circumstances suggest going to a theme park on a weekend if you can help it. However we had done some research and found that Hong Kong Disneyland should still be good on the weekend. 

We had a good sleep and were slow getting moving which was fine as the park didn't open until 10am. The park entrance was only 5 minutes on the shuttle bus from our hotel so when we were ready we just had to jump on the bus and then we we there. Very convenient!

We had some shopping business to get done first as someone left her little bag at home. So we had to get a bag, some ears and a hat for Anth. We spend a while looking through the shops and picked up a few pins plus the fore mentioned items. We were looking for breakfast then, so we headed to the bakery and waffle house on Main Street USA (the first strip in the park) It was all pretty good and Anthony enjoyed feeding his crumbs to the little birds so much I thought he had become Snow White.

We took the first obligatory photo with the castle and then headed into Tomorrow Land to ride one of the rides that was not here last time we visited which is Ant Man and Wasp. The idea is that you shrink down to the size of an an and fight alongside Ant-Man and The Wasp to prevent classified S.H.I.E.L.D. data from falling into the hands of Hydra. In short you get a gun and shoot targets while moving through the themed ride. It was pretty good (and I won).

While in Tomorrow land we quickly jumped onto Space Mountain which as normal was amazing. We next went to the new Frozen land just to have a look around. We did the rides later in the day here and they weren't worth it. The area is very small but very well themed. They had some live musicans performing while we were there.

The three lands up the back of the park are our favourites you have Toy Story land, Mystic Point and Grizzly Gulch. We headed straight to Mystic Manor which is my favourite ride! 
The background of Mystic Manor is this: You’re invited to tour the manor house and private museum of Lord Henry Mystic — eccentric adventurer, explorer and collector of art—and his faithful monkey friend, Albert. Regarded as one of the foremost museums in the world, Mystic Manor was built to house Lord Henry’s ever-growing collection of illustrious art and artifacts, including a newly acquired relic: a beautifully carved Balinese music box said to make inanimate objects spring to life with its enchanting music dust. 

The music is done by Dani Elfman and it is just amazing!

Next we spent some time in Grizzly Gulch. The story of Grizzly Gulch is that it was established on August 8, 1888 - the luckiest day of the luckiest month of the luckiest year. However, the townspeople ran into trouble when they discovered they had built their town on a field of geysers. The town was literally sinking and their fortunes went with it. The theming here is wild! And the rollercoaster is through an old goldmine with bears causing all sorts of trouble.

We were heading to Adventure land when we bumped into Grizzly Gulch Mickey mouse so we had to take a selfie!

Adventure Land is set around the jungle. But mainly today it was a place for Anthony to buy his favourite snack at Disneyland which is Grilled Squid!

Lunch time was calling us so we stopped into The Royal Banquet Hall for some food. They had these cool trolleys where you could put your food to wheel it to your table.

Back at the castle we stopped to take a few photos. Hong Kong Disney castle is new and has parts from all the Disney Princess' it is a really cool castle.

We spent the afternoon just riding rides. The lines were so short. We rode Grizzly Gulch Minecarts 4 times, Mystic Manor 3 times, Jungle Cruise, Frozen rides and a few more. 
Plus Anthony got more squid!

We went for dinner at Starlight diner and then decided we should jump on Hyperspace Mountain. There was no line. We even got to go on it by ourselves as no one was there. We rode it 2 time before having to go to the night show.

So the nighttime show Momentous, this is the explanation of it. 

With powerful and heartwarming storytelling, close to 40 classic Disney moments, and nearly 150 cherished Disney and Pixar characters, the six chapters of 'Momentous' will not only bring the iconic Castle of Magical Dreams to life, but also take guests on a wondrous journey through life. The new show will remind us just how precious time is, and to cherish every moment with our loved ones.

It was absolutley amazing! Like Anthony and I were both just like WOW! I didn't think a night castle show would affect me at all but I will say there were parts of it I actually got teary (Damn remember me from Coco) What a way to finish the day.

We took a shuttle back to the hotel dead on our feet and have just crashed at the hotel. We walked well over 20000 steps today! Goodnight and we have another travel day tomorrow as we head to Japan.
