So originally I booked two parts of this holiday. 1. Was the cruise we are going on next week and 2. Was the discounted nights at Disneyland hotel. So we had a week in the middle of these two events. We have done Hong Kong quite a few times so we were debating about what was something different we could squeeze in. Anthony suddenly exclaimed "OMG Amy! Why don't we go see the Guinea Pig Bridge" 

For those that don't know Guinea Pig Bridge was a meme song that came out 10 years ago. I have always loved it and have spent countless hours sending it to my parents TV from outside their house and playing it if I need a test video. I have included in below for your enjoyment.

We have always joked about going to see it but it was never planned for. So when Anthony suggested it, I was like "yeah, lets do that" hence why we are now in Fukuoka, Japan. Now this isn't the easiest place to get to so it definitely was going to be a multi hour adventure. 

We had booked the bullet train for 10:31am so we had a bit of time to look around before the train was to depart. We checked out a small local shrine and then headed to one of the local gardens. This place had the most beautiful spring flowers and blossoms.

We then got to the station, grabbed some Bento boxes and hopped on the train it took about 1 hour 40 min to get to our next stop which was Huis Ten Buis Station. The scenery was beautiful along the way too.

We arrived at Huis Ten Buis (which is a huge theme park based on Europe if you are interested) took some pictures and then headed off to find the shuttle bus to Nagasaki Bio Park our destination for today.

We had the whole bus to ourselves and it was a great ride, from the bus you could see all little islands and ocean.

We finally made it bought our tickets and headed into the park. It was really really hilly but beautiful. We saw some Maru's, some beautiful flower domes and  I made friends with a bat who kept climbing towards me!

We headed up through the hills again and came across some lemurs that could go anywhere they wanted in the park, they had chosen to be sunbaking on the path. Next was the American Beavers which were cool and I have included a picture of Anthony standing next to the enclosure so you can see how trusting they are of people in Japan.

The next crazy thing that happened is we cam across a huge group of Flamingoes. No cages they just have a huge area to hang in. We were allowed to feed them. The flamingos were suprisingly so gentle.

We also got to feed and pat the capybara which literally have to be one of the laziest animals in world. I also got a picture of Anthony having a gasbag with one of them.

We headed up and fed some raccoons which were also cute. I actually really love raccoons! We also got to go in with the squirrel monkeys. One of which decided I looked like a great ride and jumped on my shoulder and starting pulling my ear.

Finally it was time to see the main attraction. We went into the PAW section of Nagasaki Bio Park and got to see all sorts of cute animals. We decided to feed the Guinea Pigs as they were the reason we came and then we waited.

At 4:30pm it was time for the Guinea Pigs to go to bed and the zookeeper put down the bridge and everyone watched as all the Guinea Pigs lined up and ran across the bridge to go home. It was exactly like the video. Well worth the random trip out here.

It was a long journey back and we arrived back in Fukuoka at 8pm. We got some quick curry for dinner and enjoyed a nice walk back to the hotel. What a day! Anthony says "Guinea Pig Bridge..."
