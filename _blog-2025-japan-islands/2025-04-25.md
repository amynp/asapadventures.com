It was a really early morning as we awoke for the dawn service for ANZAC day on the boat. Ricky our cruise director had been working really hard to run his first ANZAC Day celebration as he knew it would be important to the Australian and NZ guests. So at 5:30 we got up and went downstairs to the Two70 venue. Ricky was there suited up and handing out ANZAC poppies which he had ordered in for us.  For those who are not from Australia or nor NZ,  ANZAC Day is a national day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand, held every year on April 25th. It honors the soldiers from both countries — called the ANZACs (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) — who fought during World War I, especially in the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. 

The service was beautiful, they had a live bugle player and some of the guests and Australian and New Zealand cruise members read out parts of the service. After the service they provided ANZAC biscuits and tea and coffee and we were suprised when the kitchen staff revealed the giant cake they made for us! We are very grateful for all the effort that was put into this, escpecially becuase there were on 70ish Australians and New Zealanders on the ship of 4500 people.

We ventured back to bed for a while as we had been up late the night before too. When we woke up it was time to get ready as we had a special lunch on the ship. We had booked a taste of royal which was a set menu which chose all the best bits from different resturants. It was pretty good.

After lunch I bumped into one of my new friends from the show last night Teresa and we agreed to meet up later. We all met up at juggling class which was a crazy experience with everyone throwing balls around trying to juggle. After juggling we headed to Trivia which was super hard. Anthony was the only one that got questions right and thats becuase he has the most random knowledge. E.g How many cards are in a deck of Uno? What year did the first iphone come out?
I knew pretty much nothing. Either way it was great fun.

We had to get some dinner before the night show where we would be meeting up with Teresa and Fam again. So we headed into Windjammer this time for some food. Also the answers for before are 108 and 2007. 

The Show tonight was funny bones. Funny Bones is a comedy duo made up of British performer Chris Peters and Japanese artist K-Bow. Since forming in 2002 after meeting during a street performance tour in Kyushu, Japan, they have toured world wide. Now I dont often laugh ​ or find things funny, but OMG they were so good i was full on laughing out loud. Their performance was non verbal and included miming, slapstick comedy, juggling, dance, magic done poorly and puppetry. It was seriously amazing and if they ever tour Australia I will be going to that show.
