Another travel day for us. The last few trips we have done 24 - 48 hour stop overs in countries and have really been loving it. We will be heading back to Hong Kong later in the trip though so don't worry. 

We woke up for our last morning in the beautiful Explorers Lodge hotel. We decided to head down to the buffet breakfast as we didn't have to check out til 11. It was pretty expensive but the food was good and we got to take a selfie with Goofy.

After packing and sadly checking out we had a bit of time to kill before heading to the airport so we settled at a table at the hotel and played a couple of games of Loracana.

At about 12:30 we headed to the airport. Made our way easily through check in and immigration and settled down to have some lunch. We had dim sum at the airport which was really nice.

Then it was a plane ride. We flew a budget carrier from Hong Kong to Fukuoka, Hong Kong Express. They were definitely no frills but they got the job done and before we knew it we had flown into Fukuoka. Fukuoka is not a place we have been to before. It is situated up the top of Kyushu which 
is the third-largest island of Japan's four main islands and the most southerly of the four largest islands.

We ducked into a Lawson grabbed some food, jumped on a train and found our way to our hotel. We checked in and then headed out for a quick dinner at Yoshinoya! Lets get ready for some fun exploring Japan's third largest Island.
