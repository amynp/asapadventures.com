We are so blessed and grateful that we get to be on holiday again so quickly after the last epic adventure. This trip originally came about because we got a really really good cruise deal from Hong Kong on a black Friday sale and then we built this trip around it. We have few moving parts to this trip but today starts with our trip over to Hong Kong. 

We were up and ready early and headed to the airport. (Big thankyou to my step dad Ken, dunno what we would do without you). We had gotten our airfares really cheap with points also so we were flying with Qantas. All in all, no major issues! It was a good flight, we spent most of it listening to Brandon Sanderson's new book and eating so much food on the plane. We also got chatting to the flight attendants who were all lovely. Landing in Hong Kong took a little while as they were having a storm when we arrived, however no issues landing either.

We arrived and got ourselves sorted. We did a quick trip to 7/11 bought some drinks and snacks and then headed off to the hotel in an uber.

We have stayed at the Explorers Lodge at Hong Kong Disneyland before and I adored it. I never thought we would get to come back. I also got this on a Black Friday sale which is good cause this place is super expensive. This hotel is themed to adventure, and the tropical climates of Asia, Oceania, South America, and Africa. It was so nice coming back to here and seeing all the amazing theming and elegance that disney does so well. We had a look around, did some shopping and unpacked!

We got some really cute dessert and had a quick walk around the resort. Then we got ready to turn in. We will need the energy for Disney tomorrow.
