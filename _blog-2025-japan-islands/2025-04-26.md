It was a sad morning as we had to get off the ship and make our way home. We got off the ship at about 9 o'lock and caught a uber to the main statiom. You can check in to Cathay Pacific and Qantas flights from the train station and they will send your bags to the plane from there. This is a really cool service. Our only problem was that when we checked in we did not hve the seats we had paid for. The guy at the station tried to fix it but apparently it was a full flight. He called his supervisor but said unfortunely there was nothing the could do til 4. This put a real damper on the morning. 

We still decided to do some sight seeing of Hong Kong and I wanted to head the The Palace Museum. It opened in July 2022, it showcases over 900 treasures from Beijing's Palace Museum, most of which are from the Forbidden city. It was really interesting looking through and seeing the artifacts however it was hard to fully enjoy it as we were worrying about getting our Qantas stuff organised.

We got some last minute dim sum when I got the message saying that Qantas fixed the seats. So we were at least able to enjoy lunch.

At the airport we got our tickets fixed and then spent some time in the Qantas lounge. Our flight got delayed so it was very late by the time we left. The overnight flight was not great and getting out in Melbourne took over 2 and a half hours. Either way we are lucky we had a great trip.
