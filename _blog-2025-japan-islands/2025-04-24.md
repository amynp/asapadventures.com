We woke to a rainy and cloudy morning out at sea. We were not due to reach Taiwan until 1pm which gave us plenty of time to relax on the ship and enjoy our time. Also Mark our state attendent made another towel animal!

We came back to our balcony room to watch us approach Keelung which is the main port in Taiwan. It was really nice watching the cruise ship sale in slowly.

The process getting off the boat was much easier then Japan and before we knew it we were standing in my favourite country again! Keelung's nickname is â€œThe Rainy Port", and it was very accurate for our arrival which wasn't ideal. Keelung has had a pretty turbulant past and in 1895 when it was under Japanese occupation it became a harbour. Unfortunely later in 1941 Keelung was the first target of the american bombers after Pearl Harbour and was mostly destroyed. It has built itself back up today to be a busy and important trade route in Asia. 

We were meant to be doing a self guided walking tour but it was so wet. So we decided to head to get some coffee and read the history from the tour. We also found somewhere for some lunch. We decided on some curry egg rice which was pretty good.

The rain had stopped a little by this point so we decided stuff it and we headed out to explore some of the sites. Our first stop was the Keelung Tower. Keelung Tower officially opened last year and is free to visit which made it the perfect place to go up to see the views of Keelung. It is situates between the city and all the hillside temples which was really cool.

After enjoying the city views we headed to some of the temples on the hill. These were really impressive too. They are literally up the top of a mountain!

We called an uber to head back down the mountain. We headed to Keelung's iconic "Color Houses" which are located at Zhengbin Fishing Port. It was a really pretty area.

Next to here are some ruins which used to be the Agenna Shipyard. These became popular when Chris Evans flew here to film the add for Call of Duty online. They look very apocaliptic.

Lastly we headed back to the main city to go to Keelung MiaoKou Night Market. This is the most popular market in Taiwan! It was so good. We got 2 bubble teas for $6 which is just crazy! I was also playing some crane games when the ownder came up and opened the machines and gave the prizes to me with a welcome to Taiwan! I love this country.

Once back on the ship I left Anthony in the room and headed to the Broadway show on the ship which was The Beautiful Dream. It was amazing!
