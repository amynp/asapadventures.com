After brilliant day yesterday it was early get up this morning. As my beautiful mother had bought me breakfast at Enchanted Garden for Christmas, we made our way over to have breakfast. Enchanted garden in located at the Disney Hotel and is the only breakfast where the Disney characters interact with you. The breakfast was a buffet and there was heaps on offer. We ate in between photos with the 4 Disney characters. It was a fantastic start to the day.

We jumped on a shuttle bus which took us to the park. We ran over to do the Western Railroad first. The Western Rail road is a very slow train ride around the perimeter of the park. It was a nice relaxing ride. We finished on the railroad and raced to Adventure land to watch the festival of the lion king. It is based on the musical from Broadway. I loved it, it was fantastic even though it was only 30 minutes they did a really good job of fitting all the songs in and the quality of the show was fantastic.

From here we went and took a raft to Tarzan's tree house. We did the tour of the tree house and then headed back on the raft to get to the main part of adventure land. Then we revisited some rides from yesterday Grizzly Gulch, Mystic Manor, RC Racer and Space Mountain. We did Slinky Dog which we didn't get done yesterday. While we were riding Mystic Manor the first room didn't work. So we got to stay on and ride it again.

After these rides it was time for the parade. It was a really good parade with floats from the main Disney characters, Pooh, Jungle Book, Lion King, Princess', Lilo and Stitch, and Toy Story. The people who are in these parades are so happy. It must be hard to be that happy all the time.

I decided we should get some pictures with some Princess' so we camped out near there for a bit. We got pictures with Rapunzel, Snow white, Belle and Cinderella. We were so tired we decided to shop and then go home.  While we were waiting some guy asked Anthony if he could get a photo with him. Anthony laughed and pulled out his Fez and said "Only if you wear this" So the guy did. It was so funny.

We walked down to the shops and did a lot a shopping and bought some amazing things. We made our way home to relax.
