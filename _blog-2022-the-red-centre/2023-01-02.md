Sadly today we said goodbye to Uluru and were heading back to Alice Springs. We had a quick breakfast before checking out of the hotel. We did a little bit more shopping and then we were on the road. The first stop was Uluru Camel Tours.

The camel tours is actually a cool place. They have a small museum about the history of camels in the NT. Then you can head out to see the camels around the farm. They also have a small petting zoo. We also got to see the set up for the Camel Cup so that was cool. The really cool part about this company is what they do is catch the wild camels around Uluru and train them up. Then they either keep them at the farm or send them back overseas.

Then it was the 4 and a half hour drive to Alice Springs. We had a quick stop in Erldunda for lunch and then we made it to Alice at about 4:30pm. We checked back into the hotel we were at last time and just chilled. There was some reading and some chilling and we did a quick dinner and supermarket shop. We have a big day trip planned tomorrow so the quiet night is good.
