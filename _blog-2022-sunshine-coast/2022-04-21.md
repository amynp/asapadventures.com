Well unfortunately, today was our last day on the sunshine coast. It has been such an amazing trip and its been so lovely. We thought we would have an easier day today as we were flying out in the night. Luckily the accommodation let us pay for another night so we could still go in and out of our accommodation for the day.

We headed local today and wandered down the main street of Mooloolaba towards the Aquarium. We were hoping to do the Aqua duck but it was fully booked. So we headed straight into the Aquarium. It was a smaller aquarium then the one in Melbourne but it was a good way to spend an hour or 2.

We grabbed some lunch and then chilled at the apartment. Dani and I decided to headed down to the beach and do some rockpooling. It was a quite afternoon and then we headed back to Melbourne.
