We were up early to be on the road to Canberra as we had to be at the zoo at 1.30pm. We had a quick McDonalds breakfast and then decided to do a deanie which out friend kept telling us about. According  to Macquarie Dictionary  doing a deanie is the following: To cruise the main street of Albury NSW:Â "Do a Deanie" or "Hang a Deanie"

We kept driving and made a stop at Holbrook submarine or the HMAS Otway. The HMAS Otway was built in Scotland during the mid-1960s. The submarine's upper casing, fin, and stern are preserved at Holbrook, New South Wales. We had a quick look around and a climb on it. Before jumping back in the car.

Now something strange happen next we seemed to lose time. We had planned heaps of time to get from Albury to the National Zoo but when we put it in the GPS it said we would just make it in time. So we had to hightail it to the Zoo. 3 hours later we made it just in time.

We raced into zoo and made our way down to the main reception. We didn't need to stress as we were the only ones booked in to the enrichment tour today and the lady running the tour was late herself. 

When we booked the Enrichment tour there was not a lot of information about it and no reviews. When I was telling the others about it we decided we would give it a go realising it could be good or it could be terrible.
We knew we would be making and enrichment item for a random animal and attending 2 training sessions. We had no idea which animals or what we would really be seeing or doing.  We started the tour by going to see all the behind the scenes areas. We got to look in the enrichment section and the food prep areas. The guide then told us that we would get to make enrichment
