We woke up pretty early (not on holiday mode yet) and proceeded to get ready for the day. We started by having breakfast at the hotel. We had prepared to try these crumpets Chris kept going on about and we also had bought a huge spread of what Anthony calls his "Wog Spectacular" It was all pretty good to be honest.

After breakfast it was check out time and with nothing else to do we grabbed and uber and headed to the port. When we arrived we were early for our boarding time, however they had started boarding early. The beautiful staff ushered us through check in , security, customs and onto the boat in such a quick time. It was so easy and seemless.

Before we knew it we were on the ship, checked into our muster station and sitting down for some lunch at the buffet whilst we waited for our rooms to be ready.

The food was pretty good. After eating Chris and Anthony played some italian cards and Joe and I went for a walk around the ship. We didn't have to wait long because our rooms were ready and we could unpack our stuff.

After unpacking we went to hang out in the nightclub. This area is just a seating area during the day and is situated right on top of the ship. From here we watched as we sailed away from Brisbane and started our adventure to the South Pacific.

After sail away we all headed to our cabin to watch the water and eat some cookies. We were so lucky as we saw so many whales swim past the boat. A mother whale and her baby swam so close to the boat. I didn't get pictures as they were too fast but it was such an amazing experience that I did not think we would get from a cruise ship.

We spent the rest of the time before dinner exploring the ship, winning ducks, sorting out tickets and just having fun!

Dinner onboard the carnival encounter rotates between 3 restaurants. Tonight we had dinner at Angelo's which is the Italian themed restaurant. It was really good. Great theming and service and the food was also great.

We headed straight into our double comedy act of tonight. We had Jeremy Elwood a New Zealand comedian who was very good. We then had Joe White who is an Ethiopian/Australian comedian who was also really good. It was a great way to finish the night.
