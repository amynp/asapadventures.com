Hello From Vanuatu, we arrived early in the morning and Chris and I headed for the bar before 7 to get out tender ticket for when we could get off the boat. The line was huge. However it moved quick. We were disappointed when we get group 17. We had breakfast, got organised and went downstairs roughly when the tenders started. 

However things were about to get really delayed. We have no idea why but it took 2 hours before they even took the first tender boat out. Apparently it was something with winds but who knows what is going on. We were meant to have been out for a 9 o'clock tour but in the end we did not get out until 11. We were pretty sure at this point we had well and truly missed the tour. 

We finally got off the boat and stepped onto Vanuatu making us land in our 17th country! We arrived to many locals out on the streets trying to get people to take tours and book with them. Vanuatu is still recovering from the huge earth quake that took out most of Port Villa and the cruise ships have just started coming back. 

There was also just chaos as all the local tours were delayed or had left. We had a quick look and as we expected there was no Atmosphere tours which is who we were going with. We were approached by Alfred from Yumi Tours and asked who we were looking for. When we told him Atmosphere tours he was straight on the phone and had sorted out someone to come and get us. He was under no obligation to do so. He stayed with us until his group came and then apologized that he had to go. The rest of the locals made sure we were looked after until the driver came. While we were waiting with him Alfred was explaining to us about how carnival delaying departure stuffs up all the local operators as it scares people off booking him. I can not explain how lovely and helpful this Alfred was.(He even called our driver later to confirm we had been picked up) Eventually a man named George came and picked us up to catch us up with our tour group.

George was an amazing guy. He threw us into his ute and took us off to catch up with the bus. Explaining all about Port Villa as we went. He was very proud of the new bridge the Japanese are building here and says it's the best thing built on the island. Anthony asked George many questions and we talked politics and countries and sport. He was totally awesome. We caught up to the tour group at the cultural village and were welcomed by the chief and his warriors running out from the forest pointing spears at us before being allowed in. (George had prewarned us)

We had missed a bit of the cultural visit but lucky we still got to see some of the dancing and the fire walking. Firewalking in Vanuatu is a traditional custom where locals walk barefoot over hot stones to show strength and courage. It’s a special part of village life we watched the man gets his feet covered in a local plant before walking across. It's was still absolutely crazy.

We had to leave after that and we continued with our tour bus onto lunch which was at Banana bay beach club. When we arrived the rains did too and we had a huge downpour. Luckily it was while we were eating and didn't last for two long. We had a bbq and food that was prepared for us and relaxed. There was a cool view and a lagoon outside too. Very nice spot.

We then moved on to the next stop on the tour which was Eton school. We had some donations to drop off and we got to meet a couple of the teachers. I was talking to the make primary school teacher who was explaining how school works. In a grade 1 class they have 38 kids in this tiny tiny room with just tables, a mat and a blackboard. It was crazy when I think of my own classroom and resources and the tiny amount of kids I have. Most of the staff are on strike at the moment as there have been issues with the pension payments. We met a few of the local children who were happy to try and talk to us. It was a very eye-opening part of the tour.

Back on the bus we headed to the Blue Lagoon. The Blue Lagoon is a natural freshwater pool fed by underground springs and tidal seawater, giving it a unique blend of fresh and saltwater. Its stunning **turquoise color** is caused by the high mineral content and white sandy bottom. It was very pretty but there was also lots of people swimming and it was pouring down.

We started to head out way back to the port looking the beautiful views. Picture this: winding roads lined with coconut palms, dense tropical rainforests, and volcanic hills rising in the distance. Whilst seeing farmland and animals, and roadside stalls brimming with fresh fruits and handmade crafts. It was a beautiful drive.

Our last stop of the day was to try Kava. Kava is a traditional drink made from the root of a South Pacific plant, known for its relaxing and calming effects. It’s an important part of social and cultural life in Vanuatu and other island nations, often enjoyed during ceremonies and gatherings. It was served right out of a big bin of it and It looked like mud! The taste is like drinking grass.  It also makes you tongue go numb.

We were so sad to leave Vanuatu as the people and this place are beautiful. It was such a shame that we lost 2 hours in this beautiful place! 

We got back to port. Jumped back on the boat. The night was spent going to the deal or no deal game show and eating.
