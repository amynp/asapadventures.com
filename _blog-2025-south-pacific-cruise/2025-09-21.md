I will start by saying I will explain the title of this blog post pretty much at the end of the blog as the event that caused this happened over dinner. 

We went forward an hour overnight so we all lost an hour sleep. It took us a little while to get ready in the morning but eventually we dragged ourselves downstairs for Breakfast. We had breakfast at one of the main restaurants as Anthony was keen for Eggs Benedict and Chris wanted pancakes. The food was suprisingly good for a quick morning service. Afterward we went to the Cruise director Ben's presentation on Fun on board!

We spent some time doing some walks outside and exploring the ship. We found some more ducks as well.

We decided to head to some Trivia and managed to get ourselves a seat at the Encounter Hotel. The service here was amazing and we spent the time playing Italian cards until trivia. We also got to see the amazing towel animal mascot! We did Pirate trivia and did suprisingly alright. We then decided to hang around and try celebrity trash trivia. This is where you are told 3 items from a actor or actresses movie and you have to guess the actor or actress. We did really well on this one. We were only 1 point off equal 1st.

We went and had a quick lunch and then came back to play Superhero Trivia. We (Joe and Anthony) did so well at this that they got 18/20 and won the competition. We were even given a medal. Joe was so excited he wanted to do an acceptance speech... luckily we stopped him doing that.

We headed back to the rooms for some quiet outdoor deck time and found one of the cute towel animals on our bed!

The show tonight was a musical called Seven and is based on the seven deadly sins. There was a musical number for each one and it was really really good.

We met up with Anthony for dinner and made our way to Dragon Lady which was our designated restaurant for tonight. This is an Asian inspired restaurant and was really good. You can even get bubble tea. During dinner the whole restaurant were stopped by one of the waiters who wanted to do a full dining room song where he sang Sweet Caroline with us joining in on the chorus'. He was good and it was pretty fun. Later during dinner we had one of the waitresses go past us singing "Touching bowls, touching bowls.. BA, BA, BA!" to the tune of sweet caroline. However on her quick trip past we all misheard her and were in fits of giggles.

Its been a great and relaxing day on the ship and it has been so lovely to have friends on board with us.
