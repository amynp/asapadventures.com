We had a full day at sea today! We started up by meeting for the world's largest breakfast. We had way too much food.

Then we headed over to the encounter hotel to try and win some trivia. We spent a fair while there but had no luck. But man did we suck at Dr Who Trivia! We had decided to go to the sit down restaurant for lunch as they had katsu sandwiches so we decided to go for a walk around the ship to get some energy out before that. It was so windy, we got to the front of the ship and we nearly blew away.  However at the front we saw some flying fish. I couldn't get a picture as they are tiny but I will put a photo here so you know what they look like.  Also this is the explanation of one: A flying fish is a type of marine fish known for its unique ability to glide above the surface of the water. It achieves this by building up speed underwater and then using its unusually large, wing-like pectoral fins to launch into the air. These glides can help it escape predators and may cover distances of up to 200 meters. Flying fish are commonly found in warm ocean waters around the world. They are so cool like little fairies.

We then headed to lunch and ate even more food. We then separated the party and Anthony went for a nap and Joe, Chris and I tried to win a few Trivia. We did Friends trivia which was super hard and then Aussie songs which was so much fun and we did really well in. We also did really well in tv theme songs.

I went upstairs to check on Anthony as when I got to the room there were heaps of red footed boobies flying around. The red footed Booby is a really cool bird and we watched them follow the cruise ship and dive and try to catch the flying fish it was really awesome.  Such a cool thing to get to watch.

After bird watching we went to get some snacks. Anthony didn't want to go to the musical so Chris, Joe and I made our way to Musicology. Musicology is a high-energy musical production showcasing a mix of popular songs across genres like pop, rock, jazz, and gospel. The dancing and production was really good and a great way to finish off the day.

We had dinner afterwards and then called it an early night.
