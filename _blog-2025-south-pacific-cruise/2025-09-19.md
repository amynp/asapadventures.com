Hello, Hello.
It seems like not long ago we were on an overseas adventure and our plan was to stay put until our big end of year trip. However we found a good deal that was the same time as our time off and included 2 new countries while on a cruise so who could say no to that!

We will be voyaging on the Carnival Encounter for a week and we are so lucky this trip to be joined by 2 of our really good friends Chris and Joe. Its been a little while since we had others with us so we are pretty excited, plus they are always the best to travel with. 

The trip started with a terrible drive to the airport, the traffic was horrendous there were accidents on most of the roads. We were worried for a little bit that we wouldn't make bag drop off but in the end we made it and found our way to the gate to meet up with our travel companions. As normal Melbourne Airport was running behind so it turns out we were actually delayed by 20 minutes. When we finally took off we had a beautiful sunset.

The flight was pretty chill we got a sausage roll and drinks and we amused ourselves for the 2 hour flight. It is so much nicer flying domestic.

Landing in Brisbane was pretty cool. You fly right over the CBD. I took a couple of photos on the way in.

We found our bags, grabbed an Uber and headed to the hotel. Chris has been expaining to us that QLD has the best crumpets. Apparently Hamish and Andy tested them from all around Australia and QLD had the fluffiest and best ones. So naturally our next stop was a quick run over to Woolworths before it closed. We picked up some crumpets and other items and then deciced to have dominos as it was late.

We will test the crumpets tomorrow morning but for now its bed time as we are excited for Cruise Day tomorrow.
