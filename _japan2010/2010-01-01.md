Today we got up way to early had breakfast and headed to Akihabara. It was a bit disappointing and painful, the boys think MSY is better. As we were all tired and didn't do much today this entry will be short. We did do a bit of shopping, found a disney mobile (amy wants that) and saw some show bags. The show bags were disappointing. Chipi and Rob did manage to beat the language barrier and return them. The best part of the day was Anthony found his transformers. Masterpeice Megatron and Grimlock. VERY cool.

The other thing that happened was that we hopped on a train and lost Sarma. He didn't get on in time. Luckily the trains are only 3 min apart here and we met him at the next station. Tonight we are watching Zombieland and relaxing.

At the moment the boys are playing with remote controls cars and helicopters. Should be a nice quite night to get ready for Ginza tommorow..

BTW its day 4 in japan and we are yet to see Sushi.
Pretty weird. Swanston Street here we come when we get back.
