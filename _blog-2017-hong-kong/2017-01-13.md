I was so excited this morning as today was Disneyland! We arrived before opening and got our annual passes. These were a cheaper way of getting three days in the park plus they gave us heaps of discounts. Anth pulled the best face for his photo and was pretty excited. Then without further ado we were in.

We spent the first bit of time in main street sorting out hats and trading pins. Then we decided to head to Tomorrow land. Stark expo and Iron Man Experience are brand new to the park. To be exact they opened 2 days ago. It was a great ride that takes you on a tour through hong kong to see Tony Starks new Arc reactor until something goes wrong. It is a fantastic ride and it was amazing to do a ride so close to opening. Also the queue area in this ride is also an attraction by itself.

Next we went to Hyperspace Mountain. This is now Starwars themed. It is such a great roller coaster. We had a quick meet and greet with Chewbacca which was hilarous. We had spent a but of time in tomorrow land but it was time to move on. Anthony was thrilled with the changed here as incorporating Marvel and Starwars has made this land one of the best in the park.

We spent the day going on many rides and shopping. We did Mystic manor twice as I love that ride and a few others. Anthony bought me the most amazing cogsworth and lumiere decorations which actually function Like they should so amazing.

We ate dinner after riding all the rides in tommorow land again. We decided to eat at The festival of fools which looked beautiful ay night. Unfortunately the parade was canceled so we watched the fireworks and then walked to the Disneyland hotel to book our yumcha for Monday. Our feet are killing us and it is late so I will leave you with the fact this was an amazing day.
