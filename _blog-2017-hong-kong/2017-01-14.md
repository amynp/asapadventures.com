After a huge day at Disneyland we decided to have a quieter day as our legs were sore. We woke up and had breakfast at our favourite place. I have been getting cold ovaltine for breakfast and it is the best. They make hot ovaltine and put ice in it so when you drink it the first part of the sit is cold and then it goes warm.

After breakfast we wandered out to the Museum of History. This is a free museum which shows the history of hong kong from the start if the land mass to the development of culture. It was really interesting and we spent a few hours wandering through. The most intresting bit was they had built real shop replicas in the museum.

We then went to the Charlie Brown cafe for a coffee. It was a really cute cafe with everything Charlie Brown. We only spent a brief time in the cafe and then headed to Inns point.

many hours were spent shopping around inns point. We headed to Action Robo and anth was in heaven. We decided that we would have some lunch and decide which transformers he wanted to buy. We had lunch at a japanese Ramen place which was delicious.

We spent the rest of the afternoon shopping for transformers. Anthony git 2 more and was very happy. We went out for dinner and got some dim sum. It was a quiet day but lots of fun!
