So today was our last day in Hong Kong and Disneyland. We woke up and had breakfast at the enchanted garden restaurant.. We have been here before and it was just as good this time. There was a great spread of food on the buffet and the characters wandered around. We went back and got ready for the day.

Again we wandered slowly to Disneyland from the hotel. It really is a lovely walk and again it was empty. We made it before opening and got to some serious pin trading. Today was like the other days we made sure we got everything done. We saw Mickey and the wonderous book which was a great show. The highlight of today was that the Mystic Manor jewellery box that had been out of stock was back. I was so happy.. We had lunch at the corner cafe that was delicious.

As a side note the food in Disneyland has been amazing. We have not had a bad meal. We had dinner at Fairy Tale hall and did as many rides as we could.
