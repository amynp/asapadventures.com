Having returned to our accomodation very late last night (Thankyou Joe for driving over 2 hours in the dark) We had a much slower day. We checked out of our hotel grab some McDonalds and started our drive down to Mooloolaba.

It was a nice drive with lots of laughs and very bad jokes. Chris and I were in the back and I think we giggled all the way unil our first stop at Gympie. We pulled in for some lunch in the town square. There is so much road works going on up here at the moment so it took forever to make it down. Finally we made it. Checked into the hotel and spent some time just hanging on our beautiful balcony.

Time disappeared quickly today and before we knew it it was time to head out for our sunset cruise. We walked down to the Wharf and had some drinks while waiting for the cruise. At 5 we jumped on board and got seated for the cruise. You can order drinks and fresh seafood on this cruise. The boys all good prawns and I got Calamari. Then we were off cruising around the rivers and bay. We made a stop to get the food delivered from the fish market and enjoyed our time. I learnt that Mooloolaba means Land of Snapper and Red Bellied Black Snake. We also got to see the Croc One.  It was a really lovely cruise and the boys said its some of the best prawns they have eaten.
