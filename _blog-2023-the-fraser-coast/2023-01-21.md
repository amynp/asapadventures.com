We are off again for a short trip this time. Chris and Joe are joining us on this trip. The main aim on this trip is to see the baby turtles hatching so fingers crossed. We headed out of Melbourne at midday and after a short flight we had made it to the sunshine coast. We quickly picked up our rental car and hit the road on to Hervey Bay.

Most of the day had gone so we settled into the hotel went and got a burger for dinner. After dinner and we headed down to the beach to watch the sunset. Last stop for the night was down to the icecream shop. We have an early morning tomorrow so quiet night tonight.
