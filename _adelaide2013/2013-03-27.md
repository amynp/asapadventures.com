We were staring our journey home today and we decided to have breakfast at Mount Lofty summit. The view and food were amazing and a great start to the day. We stayed a while to take some pictures of the view of Adelaide

We then headed to Handorf which is a German village in Adelaide. We were looking foeward to this, however it was not exactly what we had pictured. We looked around the shops then decided to have lunch in a traditional German fashion. We had sausages. They were expensive but they were ok.

The rest of the day was spent driving to Horsham where we are staying for the night. 
It was a fantastic day.
