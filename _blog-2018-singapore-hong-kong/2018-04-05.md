Our original plan today had been to head up to the Wetlands to do some walking. However it was hot and the buses were not running as often as we wanted so we made some last minute changes. Anthony wanted to go on a boat and then somehow we ended up booking tickets to the river safari and catching a taxi to go there. Driving to the zoo I realised just how amazingly green Singapore is. Everywhere you look theres re trees and plants all beautifully kept. They have also been careful about the sex of the trees they plant so that the have an equal balance of pollen. Ever bridge that crosses a road is also planted with flowers on the side it really is a concrete jungle.

We made it to the river safari, swapped our prebooked tickets for physical ones and then headed into the park. You start the river safari by entering the Manatee and Giant Otter exhibit which is beautiful. I love watching the enormous otters playing.

We then headed into to Squirrel monkey forest and arrived just in time for feeding. The cool thing about this exhibit is you are actually right in with the animals. We has monkeys jumping over our heads and the smaller ground animals running across the path. We spent a while in here taking photos and watching these amazing animals.

After a long time in the monkey cage we headed to the River Reservoir Cruise. The cruise takes you out into the Reservoir that all the Singapore Zoo's join up to. They show you the work the have done to increase the habitats of the native animals. It is pretty amazing.

The next stop was another boat ride called the Amazon river quest. This ride takes you through a lot of different exhibits of animals by boat. It was very nice. We went on it twice.

We stopped for lunch at a cafe and got a coconut again. I really enjoy coconut juice.

Then it was on to see the Pandas. They were so cute and active. The exhibit has red pandas and normal panda's. We spent ages in there watching them.

We saw a few more animals. But when we were watching the monkeys we also saw a wild monkey on the outside of the cage. Turns out he has a girlfriend on the inside.

We then took some local buses out to the burbs on Singapore to go to a games shop. We got some dice but the games shops here are pretty boring. We had a bite to eat back at Bugis Junction and then had a break at the hotel until it was dark and we could go get some night pictures. We spent a while down at the Marina taking some shots.
