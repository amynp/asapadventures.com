It was up fairly early this morning for us to start our adventure of Singapore. We started by going to star bucks so Anth could get his coffee. Then headed on to the MRT to go down to Clarke Quay. On the walk to the MRT we remembered just how hot Singapore is...

At Clarke Quay we had prebooked to go on the Singapore River Cruise which takes you around Singapore by bum boat. We had heard good things about this cruise. We boarded with only another 2 couples on the boat. It was an absolutely amazing cruise. The commentary was good and it took us all around Clarke Quay, Singapore Bay, The Merlion, Marina Bay Sands. Not only was it a great ride but the man on the boat did an amazing job taking photos of the people on the boat. It was like we were in a private moving photo shoot. The couple we sat next to were an older couple from England. It was great having them to talk to on the cruise to.

After the amazing cruise we decided to trek through the heat to Central Perk. This friends themed cafe is hilariously located in the Central Mall shopping plaza. We decided to have a late breakfast here and in the end we spent about an hour in the air conditioning watching friends episodes and looking around at all the friends props. It was a really really cool place!

Then it was onto China Town for lunch. We strolled through the market and tried to avoid men selling suits. We stopped past Buddha Relic Tooth temple and decided to go inside to have a look. I had to borrow a scarf to cover my shoulders to get in. It was worth it the place is beautiful.

After the temple we headed to the Maxwell Hawker Stalls to get some cheap lunch. We joined a long like to get some Chicken Rice. Lunch was soooooo delicious and cheap! I love Singapore Hawker Stalls.

Feeling Full it was onto our last stop for the Day Garden by the bay. We went on the walkway between the super trees first and we were not overly impressed by this. So we headed to the flower dome. The dome was amazing. So many pretty flowers and they also had the Japanese Sakura trees. We had an amazing glass of Sake too.. We took soooo many pictures of flowers so I will just share a few.

We decided to have a break before the Cloud forest so we walked on over to Satay by the Bay to get some Satay sticks. They were delicious.

Back at Cloud Forest we enjoyed a walk through the man made rain forest. It is such a beautiful place and all air conditioned which was lovely. The whole walk is around a huge man made waterfall covered in plants.

Tired and sore we headed back to our home base. We ventured out to go the supermarket and find dinner which we did at Bugis Junction. It was a great but hot day in Singapore.
