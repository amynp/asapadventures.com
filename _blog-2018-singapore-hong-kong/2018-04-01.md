We arrived at Melbourne Airport at around 9 am and found checking in and getting through security was actually much quicker then normal which was great. We had decided because of the new diets we are on we would take our own food on the plane as we are pretty fussy eating. Turns out this was the best idea ever.

Melbourne Airport has some really cool bears on display at the moment. So we stopped to admire them for a while. My favourite one is the cyborg one.

The plane ride went quickly and I watched Shape of Water, Coco and The greatest showman. We arrived in Singapore after a short delay becuase of thunderstorms. I realised that having my own food on the plane and ensuring i drank electroyltes and minerals while flying ensured that for the first time ever I felt well when we landed. YAY!

We disembarked and found our way to the MRT. We both still had MRT cards from last time. Both cards still had money on them, however Anthony's had expired. We spoke to a lady at the counter and she transferred his funds to a new card. I am now jealous as his MRT card is so much better then mine.

We settled into our very small hotel and decided to go for a walk. We went and checked out Bugis night Market and ended up grabbing Carrot cake (does no have carrots) at the hawker stall for $3. Tired we are going to bed for the night for a big day tommorow.
