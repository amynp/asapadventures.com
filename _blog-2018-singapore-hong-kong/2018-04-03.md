As we had completed a fair chunk of todays itinerary yesterday we decided to use this day to go to Universal Studios. I am such a theme park buff so I cannot complain.  We took the train over to Sentosa Island. We walked our way to Universal Studios. We had pre-bought our tickets online so entry was very simple. There is a trolls event going on at USS which we didn't go to but the rainbow at the front looked cool.

We wandered into the park and decided to head straight to the battle star galactica rides. I did not take many photos today because my bag spent a lot of time in free lockers. Both roller coasters are dueling coaster and the Cylon ride was terrifying. We spent the rest of the day going on the Mummy 5 times and completing all the other rides in the park. It was a great day and I will add some photos I took below.

After a tiring day but wonderful day at Universal we went to Chinatown to go to Chinese Food Complex which is a large Hawker Stall in the area. It is pretty amazing. Below I will link a video of the Maxwell Hawker Stall so you can see what it was like.

Tomorrow we are heading out to Jurong Bird park. More walking I hope my legs hold up.
