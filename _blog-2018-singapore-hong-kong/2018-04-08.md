We arrived at Kowloon hotel before 9 ready to embark on our Dolphin Watch adventure. The tour bus picked us up and we took the 25 minute journey to the pier. On the way there we were told information about the Chinese White Dolphins that we would be seeing today.

We boarded the boat and headed out to the sea. The first part of the trip took us out past the airport and the construction they are doing to make a freeway between Hong Kong and Macau. It was such a nice day in Hong Kong and sitting on the boat was lovely.

Once we were out at sea it was time to dolphin spot. We were super lucky and saw lots of dolphins and baby dolphins. It was amazing watching them swimming around. They are super fast.

It was then back to the dock and back into the city. This tour was way worth the money.

We decided that for lunch we would head across to Cheung Chau Island.It is a 1 hour ferry ride to get there. Anthony wanted to try Baked Clams that we missed last time. We went for a quick walk around and got some snacks and lunch. It was super hot so we didn't stay too long.

After we got back we headed onto Hong Kong Island. We organised some things to get made and went for a walk around the neighborhood.
