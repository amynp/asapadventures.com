Our broken hill trip started off with a very long outback drive through pretty much nothing! All the stops on the way were truck stops with nothing else. Luckily we had drinks and food in the esky in the car. I am going to break the broken hill blog into activities so it will be a bit different from normal.

The words biggest painting:
This was in a shop and is a huge nearly 360 degree panting showing off Broken Hill and surrounds. It was actually really cool and does hold the Guiness World Record for being the largest picture.

Bells Milkbar:
Is one of the oldest still running traditional milkbars from the 1950's. It sells spiders, sandwiches and milkshakes. It was a really awesome place to visit and the spiders were delicious.

Silverton:
Silverton is pretty much an outback ghost town now where a lot of movies are made including the Mad Max series. There are a few things to see and do and a really awesome pub to have lunch in. It is literally in the middle of the outback so that in itself makes it worth a visit.

BrokenHill Outback Resort:
Where we stayed. Beautiful scenery and sunsets.

Daydream Mine:
Interesting un touristy tour in the middle of nowhere. The mine was interesting though difficult to climb into and the owner was a bit grumpy. But I would recommend going. Also the scones were amazing.

The big bench:
Hahaha what can i say its a big bench.

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2021outbacknsw/2022-01-01/PXL_20220104_052841681.MP.jpg_compressed.JPEG" /></div>

The miners heap:
A huge lookout literally on top of a mining heap. It has a memorial as well.

Outback Astronomy:
One of the best tours I have ever done. It is interesting, educational and the lady who ran it was so passionate. You recline on your outside chairs and get talked through the night sky. Really really amazing.

Royal Flying Doctors:
What a interesting place. We learnt so much about the service and how it works and how much support it gives those in the outback. We both loved this tour so much.  

<div class="center-image"><img src="http://photos-1.asapadventures.com/blogs/2021outbacknsw/2022-01-01/PXL_20220105_003659225.jpg_compressed.JPEG" /></div>

Broken Hill Outback Sculptures:
Now I loved these but the sunset sculpture does not set with the sun through it. Still absolutely stunning and worth th visit. The sculptures are beautiful as are the views.

Broken Hill was really amazing. Well worth the visit even though it is such a long way out.
