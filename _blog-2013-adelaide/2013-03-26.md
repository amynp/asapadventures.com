Today we did a trip to Adelaide zoo. We started by walking down to the river to see about a boat that would take us to the zoo. The river in Adelaide is beautiful we walked along until we found the tour boat, which was just about to leave. Talk about timing. The boat trip was nice. The view along the river was stunning and the guy in the boat knew so much about the river and the history.

After the fascinating trip up the river we disembarked at the zoo boat dock. We walked across to the zoo and skipped the lines as Anthony and I are Melbourne Zoo members which gets us free entry into Adelaide zoo as well. I was so excited to see the pandas which is the main reason we came to Adelaide. I was not disappointed When we entered the zoo I got to get my photo taken with a giant panda and then we made our way to the real thing. They were so cute!!!! They nearly do not look real. We got to have a look around the rest of the zoo and saw lots of amazing animals. We then got to go in with some goats which is not something you normally see at the zoo. We had some lunch in the food court and the service was so slow. While we were eating i went into the panda shop and got some panda stuff for me and Ava. We looked at some more animals and then made our way back to the pandas. We left the zoo and walked back and had a look in Adelaide.

Tired we  headed back to the hotel for a rest. We headed into the CBD for dinner and had dinner at a nice little Japanese restaurant. On the way back to the hotel. Anthony stopped into Pandora to buy me a panda charm. :)

Later that night we went down to the river to try and get some pictures of the city at night. I think they turned out pretty well.

It was a fantastic day.
