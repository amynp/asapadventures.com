We spent the day trying to trying to cram all of our stuff into our suitcase before we headed to the airport who would have thought we would need so much stuff for 7 days. Our flight was leaving at 4:25pm so we decided to get some sushi before we left. From Melbourne to New Zealand is not far so within 4 hours we would be there. We spent that time watching Cinderella on Anthonyâ€™s tablet which was a good movie. We arrived in Auckland at around 10:30pm New Zealand time. When we arrived at Auckland Airport we were greeted by a huge wooden carved maori gate avery nice way to be greeted into this country. Getting out of the airport, through customs was a breeze. When we arrived in the main part of the airport, we saw these huge statues from lord of the rings. They had a sign saying they were on loan from middle earth. They were very impressive. Walking through the airport we found our way to the bus terminal and found the bus that would get us too the city. 40 minutes later we were at our hotel which we were not impressed with, we unpacked and went to sleep.
