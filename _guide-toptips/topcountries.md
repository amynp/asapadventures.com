Hello, We’ve been lucky enough to travel to a bunch of amazing countries, and some of them have really stuck with us. In this post, I’m sharing a few of our favorites—places we loved, memories we can’t forget, and maybe even some spots you’ll want to add to your own travel list. This post may change depending on new countries we visit but for now these are my top 5 countries we have visited. 

# 1. Taiwan
Taiwan stole our hearts! From the moment we arrived, the people made us feel welcome, often going out of their way to help us or even just to talk to us. The food is incredible—night markets are a must, and nothing beats sipping bubble tea while wandering the  energetic streets. The nature is stunning and easy to explore, from the serene tea fields to relaxing hot springs, and of course, Taroko Gorge is an adventure we’ll never forget. Even a visit to the zoo was a joy! Taiwan perfectly blends warmth, flavor, and breathtaking scenery in every corner. There is something about this country that just feels like home, I cannot describe it.

# 2. Cambodia
Cambodia is unforgettable. Friendly locals, amazing food, and hands-on cooking experiences make it a feast for the senses. Everywhere we went we felt safe, looked after and like we were a local. Exploring ancient temples feel straight out of an adventure film as well as being able to listen to the stories of locals as you wander. Tours like APOPO and Phare show how much good is happening here and were some of the best experiences we have had. It’s a country that stays with you long after you leave.
