Hello, We’ve been lucky enough to travel to a bunch of amazing countries, and some of them have really stuck with us. In this post, I’m sharing a few of our favorites—places we loved, memories we can’t forget, and maybe even some spots you’ll want to add to your own travel list. This post may change depending on new countries we visit but for now these are my top 5 countries we have visited. 

# 1. Taiwan
Taiwan stole our hearts! From the moment we arrived, the people made us feel welcome, often going out of their way to help us or even just to talk to us. The food is incredible—night markets are a must, and nothing beats sipping bubble tea while wandering the  energetic streets. The nature is stunning and easy to explore, from the serene tea fields to relaxing hot springs, and of course, Taroko Gorge is an adventure we’ll never forget. Even a visit to the zoo was a joy! Taiwan perfectly blends warmth, flavor, and breathtaking scenery in every corner. There is something about this country that just feels like home, I cannot describe it.

# 2. Cambodia
Cambodia is unforgettable. Friendly locals, amazing food, and hands-on cooking experiences make it a feast for the senses. Everywhere we went we felt safe, looked after and like we were a local. Exploring ancient temples feel straight out of an adventure film as well as being able to listen to the stories of locals as you wander. Tours like APOPO and Phare show how much good is happening here and were some of the best experiences we have had. It’s a country that stays with you long after you leave.

# 3. Japan
Japan is a country full of surprises at every turn. The people are polite, thoughtful, and always happy to help, and the food is incredible—whether it’s sushi, ramen, street snacks, or grabbing something quick from Family Mart or Lawson. From bustling cities (and I mean busting) to tranquil temples, serene gardens, and even the magic of Tokyo Disney, there’s always something new to explore. Japan perfectly blends tradition, modern life, and a little everyday magic, making it a place you’ll never forget.

# 4. New Zealand
New Zealand stole our hearts with its stunning landscapes—from snow-capped mountains and lush forests to sparkling lakes and rugged coastlines. It’s extra special to us because we got married here, which has left us with some great memories. Newzeland is stunning to drive through and has awesome wildlife experiences. With its mix of adventure, beauty, and unforgettable memories, New Zealand will always have a special place in our hearts.

# 5. Hong Kong

Hong Kong is a city that buzzes with energy and charm. We might not have loved it the first time we went but the more you uncover you will see what an amazing gem it is, The food is incredible—especially dim sum, which we could eat every day! From exploring vibrant streets and markets to soaking in stunning harbor views, there’s always something to discover. And yes, Hong Kong Disneyland is hands-down the best one we’ve ever been to! Pure magic! Between the food, sights, and unforgettable experiences, Hong Kong is a city we’ll always love.
