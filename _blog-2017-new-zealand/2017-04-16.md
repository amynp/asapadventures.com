It was a very early get up to drive to Hobbiton this morning. This was the only tour time we could move into after our Dinner tour was cancelled a few nights ago. We made it for the tour which started at 9.10 and before we knew it we were in the bus heading through the Alexander Farm. The Alexander Farm as it is, is a beautiful farm and looking at the rolling hills and green grass you can understand why Peter Jackson choose to put Hobbiton here. Finally we arrived in Hobbiton.

Hobbiton was just as beautiful as I remembered. We went into the the garden first where our tour guide explained to us that everything around us is real. All the vegetables and garden are managed by staff who grow and use the vegetables. We wandered around through the hobbit hole and the hills and listened to stories about how the movie was filmed. It was very interesting looking at the different sized hobbit holes as well. Hobbiton is really just a beautiful place.

After touring the hobbit holes we made our way to the Green Dragon Inn. We spent some time in here having a drink and enjoying the ambiance. Rob and I had some fun dressing up as hobbits. The Green Dragon Inn is so well crafted, it is a great place to relax and have a drink. The 4 drinks the Green Dragon serve are only purchasable here. There was a pale ale, a dark ale, a cider and a ginger beer. I got the ginger beer and Anthony got the Pale Ale. We enjoyed our drinks and relaxed in the awesome tavern until it was time for our lunch.

Lunch was our swap from what should have been our wedding dinner. It was in a beautiful party marquee next to the green dragon inn. It was a huge buffet with the most yummy food. And we were quickly seated and ready to start our delayed wedding lunch. After lunch we went out to do a bit photo shoot which was fun and then before we knew it, we had to get on the bus to leave Hobbiton.

After Hobbiton we drove to Auckland. We stopped at Mt Eden and walked up to top to have a look over Auckland. It was a really nice place to go. The crater in the hill up there is amazing. Unfortunately this was the end of our trip. I am so sad to leave New Zealand. This has been the most amazing trip. The 6 others that I have traveled with have been awesome and I will miss seeing them every day.
