It was an early wake up today so we could drop off our amazing jucy mobile and catch a plane to Wellington. That all went fairly smoothly and within 50 minutes of getting on the plane we arrived in Wellington. We did not have a great day today. The lady at the Jucy office took about 1 billion years to fill out the paper work so it took forever to get into the cars and into Wellington.

And that good friends is where our story takes a path for the worst we arrived at the Thorndon Hotel Wellington where we were staying for 3 nights. Long story short the hotel stuffed up our booking and were very rude so we had no hotel for the night as they were fully booked. I called booking.com and spoke to Joe who was so amazing and he organised new accomodation for 3 nights and the other hotel will have to pay the difference. This is the short story as the events took place over 3 hours. I have learnt that I will always book through booking.com from now as they were amazing.

We went for a walk around the city and then Joe called with our new hotel. We booked in. Had a great dinner and did some walking around the city. This day was very stressful and hopefully the zoo tomorrow will get me back in a good mood.
