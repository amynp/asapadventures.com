It was an early get up for the wedding as the beautiful Madi and Jacqui had booked for me to get my hair done. Madi and I explored the town to find some breakfast. We had a nice breakfast and made it to our hair appointment. We spent an hour and a half getting our hair done and then it was time to go and get organised.

Very quickly we were dressed and ready and on our way to the Registry Office. Before I knew it we were there and were married. The registrar Pauline was hilarious and it was a really nice, quick and happy ceremony. I have felt for a while that Anth and I were married and it was nice to finally legalise the relationship Anthony and I have had. He is an amazing person, loyal and the best person I know so it was wonderful to celebrate our commitment to each other.

The photos here a just a couple and not all of them. Will update them later.

Ceremony over and after lots of hugs and giggles we were done and it was out to lunch. Now today was actually a cyclone day and the weather wasn't great. We were told not long after the ceremony that all tourist attractions, and schools etc. would be closing to make sure everyone was safe from the cyclone. In our wedding attire we went down to the shop to reschedule Hobbiton which was where we were having our wedding dinner. (It was such a shame to have to change our plans)

Still in our wedding attire we had lunch at the Pig and Whistle which was lovely and then went to Countdown (Woolworths) to get supplies as no one was meant to be going out that night. This is how we managed to spend our first night as a married couple bunkered down in a room watching movies with our friends while the cyclone happened around us.

Luckily for us we missed the worst of it. And there is always the saying that it is good luck for it to rain on your wedding day. Well seeing we had a cyclone on ours it bodes very well for our future together as that must be extra lucky. It was a lovely wedding however unfortunate the rest of the day was bracing ourselves for a cyclone. Either way I married the man of my dreams and together we can get through anything.
