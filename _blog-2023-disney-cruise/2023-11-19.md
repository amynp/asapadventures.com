Last night was a really rough night at sea and this morning we were told the whole day was going to be very rocky. We had a bit of a sleep in this morning and then decided to get some brekafast before we got ready. We headed to Tritons mainly just to grab some Mickey Waffles. They were pretty good. We also got to sit in front of the very impressive hand tiled mosaic of Ariel.

Anthony went up to get ready and I headed out with Jess to go to one of the Learn to Draw classes. This time we did Hei Hei. This one was a lot easier this time.

After the learn to draw class I headed towards the Crown and Fin pub to go to a watch seminer that Anthony was interested in. We got a cool window seat and got to see lots of Albatross and the high waves. This is my favourite spot to sit in. The watch talk was pretty good plus we got a free bracelet.

Baby racing was happening next in the Atrirum. It is where any crawling age baby can join the race to be crowned the winner in Jack Jacks diaper race. It was actually very adorable and fun!

We had lunch at Tiana's and got to chat with our South Australia friends a bit more. It was nice just having a casual lunch and a chat. 
We spent the afternoon doing more trivia and learning to draw in the Crown and Finn pub.

We got dressed in our pirate gear and headed to our evening entertainment which was the Magician show. He was so amazing especially because at this point the ship was really rocking. After the show Jimmy came out to announce that it was not safe enough to position the boat for fireworks tonight. He promoised they would try again tommorow night.

We had a bit of time before dinner so we went and had a quick photo with Hook and Smee and then headed to 'A pirates life for me' game show. it was a lot of fun. All the events are run so well on here.

Dinner was pirate themed but at Animators Palate again. It was so cute and themed. All the servers were dressed up as pirates too and all the peoples costumes were so cool. Some people put so much effort into dressing up.

Anthony didn't want to head up for the pirate night deck party. So Jess and I went our and partied. It was full of great music and dancing with good pirates vs the bad pirates as the theme for the show. We had a great time and we finished dancing the night away after 11. It was such a fun day.
