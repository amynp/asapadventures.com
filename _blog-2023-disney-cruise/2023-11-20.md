I cannot believe its our last full day on the ship. We took it very easy today. We spent the morning sitting in Frenchh Quater Lounge with Jess and we did a couple of drawing classes a little trivia which was super hard and drank some coffee. The best thing was we lost trivia but there were 2 extra Trivia medals so Jess got up to try and win one by singing! She was amazing! Unfortunely some kids won the medals.

We all headed to meet up with Tammy (Jess' Mum) to go to the next anyone can cook series. This time the chef was making Apple Studel. It was so interesting to watch him make it and he showed it step by step. At the end we got to same some and it was delicious.

The afternoon was spent doing more trivia we nearly won the Broadway musical one. and Walking around the ship. We spent ages chatting with Matthew and Tammy who is has been an asolute joy to spend time with. He has been telling all about his work at Walt Disney World and it is just so interesting.

We had our final show for tonight which was Disney Dreams and wow was it amazing. You cannot take photos during the show so I have attached some promotional ones. I cried during this show it was so good. It follows a little girl who is about to grow up when Peter Pan appears to encourage her to never let go of her dreams. It had heaps of amazing characters and songs.

Our last dinner on the cruise was the one I was most excited for dinner at Tiana's Place! The atmosphere was amazing as you enter everyone is dressed in the outfits from the resturant in the movie. You are given some beads to wear too. While you are eating what was a delicious dinner you have the Jazz players singing and playing live music and they were good. Tiana then comes out and greets people and the alligator runs around pretending to play his trumpet. It then ends in a huge party where everyone gets up and dances. it was so much fun and to end it off we had the best dessert.

To finish of this absolutely amazing trip we had fireworks. We met up with the gang and also met up with Tara and Trevor who we have not seen all trip. The fireworks were such a magnificant and such a great way to end the cruise. It has been a great 5 days on the cruise and worth every dollar we have spent.
