It was on the road again today and it was a big one. We were travelling from Lake Tekapo to Dunedin. If you look on a map it is pretty far. We had a few stops planned so after a quick coffee in town we were on the way. 

We had planned to stop for more salmon as we had to drive past Lake Pukaki again, however we found a new place a little further along in Twizel. It was the home of the Glacial Mountain salmon and not only could you eat it but you could see them and feed them. It was really cool and well worth the stop.

Continuing on we did a quick detour towards the clay cliffs to see where one of Anth's friends grew up and then we headed across to Vanshied World which is a fossil place. This place was small but had some interesting fossils. It is in the middle of nowhere  and we were the only ones there.

Next stop was Whitestone cheese where we had delicious (although way too much cheese goodness) It was really good though the tasting plate was a really good buy!

After too much cheese we headed to the Moeraki Boulders. We had seen these on youtube and Anthony wasn't super keen but I wanted to go so we parked and walked down the beach to the boulders. The beach was beautiful and the boulders were actually amazing.

We made our way into Dunedin and headed out on a ghost tour with Hair raiser ghost tours. Andrew our ghost leader and owner of the company took us around Dunedin CBD and told us some of the tales of the city many year ago. From postal bombings, to fires and all the history crime and ghost sightings he has heard about. He was amazing and it was sch an interesting tour. He took us into the old jail at night which was really creepy. A great wy to see Dunedin and here some of the history of this interesting town.
