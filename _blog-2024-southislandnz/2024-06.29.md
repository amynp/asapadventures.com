Anthony decided he wanted to head away for his birthday this year and decided New Zealand  was the place to go. So here we are on a trip to explore the South Island of New Zealand and all the beauties it offers.

I luckily managed to get Qantas business class tickets with our points so this would be one of our first times flying business class so we were pretty excited. We got to skip the line for bag drop, got an express pass for the security and then got to hang in the business class lounge. Before long it was time to jump on our plane.

The flight was great. We got pampered and got good food. I watched wish and just enjoyed having much more room on a plane.

The flight from Melbourne to Christchurch takes you over the Southern Alps and Mt Cook. The views were beyond gorgeous what an amazing view on the way in to Christchurch. It was also very cool that you could see the glaciers as on our previous trip we got to go on the Mt Cook Glacier.

The rest of the night involved us picking up the jucy and doing a very dark 2 and half hour (3 hour wih my driving) drive to Kaikoura. We found where we were staying and then headed to a local tavern to get some food. We had some very delicious burgers and hung out with the locals before heading back for the night. Whale Cruise tommorow.
