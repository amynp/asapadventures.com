Ok quick story time to start today off. Originally we rented a condo campervan from juicy. They didnt have any and we got upgraded to a chaser. The chasers bed in the campervan is not the size advertised instead it is an l shape with a hole on one side of the bed. Night one we did not sleep well or at all because unlike the camper we were meant to get this bed was not made for 2. Last night we decided to book a hotel room as it was that bad. Today we decided to go back to Jucy and see what they could do. Ths morning we headed back to Jucy and had to wait forever to be seen however we will say they were fantastic and we ended up swapping it for a small car as they still had no condos. This is fine for us and we stopped at Mcdonalds for a coffee and to reorganise all the accomodation. In good new this is much much much less stressful to drive.

After sorting all that out it started raining so we decided we would head to the International Antartic Centre.

We started with a trip aboard the Hägglunds, an amazing all-terrain amphibious Antarctic vehicle that’s been built to conquer the rough terrain on the ice. These are used o get around Antartica. We were buckled in and went on an obsacle course feeling what it’s like for scientists in Antarctica as they travel across the ice, up and down hills, over crevasses and through water. It was super fun.

Next we entered the centre and has a look at some of the information. We saw where all the bases are on Antartica and earnt that each base is in the timezone of their main port. We thn checked out the little blue penguins who are all rescue penguins they can have up to 15 here at the centre.

We had a little bit of tie before the 4D movie. So I went to check out the husky zone and got to have cuddles with some of the huskies and learn about the work they do down in Antartica. They were so soft.

We headed back to the 4D theatre  and this is the description they give you. Our 4D movie theatre has it all. Over the course of a short film you’ll be wobbled in your seat, have mist and wind blown into your face, feel things grabbing at your legs and see incredible 3D sights on the screen. It was a pretty cool moving showing Antartica.

Next we headed to the indoor polar storm room  this room is chilled to -8 degrees Celsius and buffeted by a -18°Celsius wind chill machine. This was the same temperature at Mawson Station was today. It was amazing how cold it was in the storm. The wind chill is no joke.

We had a look around the rest of the centre did the polar plunge challenge and then headed back to the hotel for a bit,

We headed down to check out riverside market and get some dinner at a really cool ramen resturant. It was a pretty fun day.
