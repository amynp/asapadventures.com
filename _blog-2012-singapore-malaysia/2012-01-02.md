Today was a quieter day in the scheme of things. We had our last buffet breakfast with Sarma and then we sent him on his way back to Malaysia. We will meet up with him in KL in a few days.

When we got back to the hotel, Steve and I went for a swim and a relax until about noon. Anthony and I decided to head out for a wander and booked a duck tour for 5:30. Steve joined us and we headed down near Clarke Quay to see the Merlion. The Merlion was interesting, he is a half lion half fish. The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temaesk, which means "sea town" in Javanese The lion head represents Singapore's original name,  Singapura -meaning "lion city".

We walked around for a bit, but as Steves feet were causing him grief stopped at a Chinese restaurant for lunch. It was a nice lunch, and the pork dumpling were some of the best I have had. once we got out of lunch we found ourselves near Marina bay Sands. Steve could not walk any more and decided to take a taxi to the Singapore flyer where the Duck tour would begin. Anthony and I decided to walk through Marina Bay Sands.

It is an amazing shopping centre. In the middle there are huge man made rivers that you can take Gondola rides on. We were going to do one but we were running out of time. The shops have all the big brands and we stopped to have a look at a few of them.

Once we reached the duck tour and met up with Steve it was nearly time to go. The duck tour was loud and it was hard to hear the commentary. It took us on land and in the river to see some of Singapore main sights. It would have been much better if I could hear what the lady was saying. I managed to get some good photos on the way. I love this new camera it is amazing!!!

Steve decided to head home after the tour due to pain. Anthony decided to take me to Little India to have a look and to have dinner at a banana leaf restaurant which I had mentioned to him. A banana leaf restaurant is something the serve in India where your food is all served onto a banana leaf instead of a plate. Dinner was fantastic and I don't often like Indian food. We learnt that if you like the meal you fold the Banana leaf towards you when you are done. If you don't like it you fold the other way. On the way home we passed some Indian market stall and I got 2 handmade bags for $10. It was a nice day today.
