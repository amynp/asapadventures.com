Well we arrived at Singapore with only a few dramas. To be fair all the dramas happened at Darwin Airport. Steve ended up getting a wrap which he couldn't eat because they hadn't listed the proper ingredients. We also nealy missed the plane due to silly lines. All in all though we got here safely.

Singapore airport is very efficient. We had cleared immigration, and got our bags within 20 minutes. They are very organised. Sarma met us at the airport (without a welcome sign) and we took the sky train to another terminal and then took the local train to our station which is Bugis. The heat and humidity wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. We walked the two blocks to our accomodation and happily dropped in our bags.

We were all a bit hungry so we went for a wander into the ARAB quarter. It was about 11o'clock Singapore time and there were many places open. We went by the rule of where are the most locals and settled at a table out on the street. I ordered Mee Goreng Ayam which is chicken with noodles and a mango juice.All of this costed $7 which is about $5.30 Australian. Full and happy we went for a walk around the Arab quarter and saw many people smoking Shesha pipes (they all smelt quite nice).

We purchased local sim cards and stocked up on water from a local 7/11, and yes they have slurpees. Exhausted we went to bed.
