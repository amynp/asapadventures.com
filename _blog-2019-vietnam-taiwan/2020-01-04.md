Today was our last day in Taiwan. I was soo sad. We had to be at the airport very late at night so we had the whole day to explore Kaohsuing. 
First we headed out for a quick breakfast and then back to the hotel to pack. The hotel was happy to hold our bags so we decided to adventure out to see where the day would take us.

We headed to Love river in the thought of taking a cruise down the river. However when we got there we saw the hop on hop off bus and decided a tour around the city would be nice. When we travel we end up being a bit like a whack a mole game and end up popping up in different locations in the city which means you dont actually get a good overview of the city. The bus tour was 40 minutes for the full loop and taught us a lot about Kaohsuing as well as giving us good views of the city. This town actually has the 13th biggest port in the world which for a small country is interesting.

After a loop we decided to keep taking the bus and get off at Pier 2 Art Centre. This is an area that has convereted old warehouses into shops and art spaces. They have installed all different art works around the place. We looked at some of the shops which are all individual artists they were pretty cool. After shopping we headed to get some shaved ice as we had not had any this tip. We stopped at a place called Ice Papa and it was amazing. We also picked up some mochi with strawberries in it too.

From here we saw advertising for an art exhibition by Shu Yamamoto which was famous paintings all done as cats. Rob of course really wanted to see it so in we went. The exhibition was amazing. It had about 60 peices of art work which were so good as well as some interactive spaces. It was a great place to spend some time.

Unfortunelty after playing in the Art space it was time to go home. We had prebooked the HSR train as we had to get from the bottom of the country to the airport at the top of the country. Within no time we arrived at Taipei Airport and were waiting for our flight.

It has been such an amazing trip. I also love Taiwan so much and wish I could stay!! 
Thankyou to the people who have joined us :)
