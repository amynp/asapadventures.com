It has been a long 2 days to get here. We finished up work on Friday and headed to the airport to fly out. We took a while hoping a stupid parcel would come but when it didn't we made our way to the airport to meet up with Rob. Check in and customs was quick so we stopped to have dinner at the bar in Terminal 2.

The flight was ok but it had so much turbelance the seatbelt sign didn't go off for the whole 9 hour flight. So you can imagine how much sleep there was. I took a video of Rob's tea he was trying to have.

We arrived in Taiwan (our stopover) at about 5am Taiwan time. We found some comfy couches and relaxed for bit while we waited for Steve and Bec who have been travelling in Taipei. We met up at the gates and has some time to catchup and take pictures of sleepy Rob.

It was then just a short 3 hour flight across to Hanoi :) We arrived tired but happy to be done with flying for now.

We got our Sims at the airport and went out to meet our driver. It was then we realised we had a problem as the driver did not have a big enough car even though we had booked for the right amount of people and luggage. After we played Tetris with the car and literally stacked suitcases on us we finally were on the crazy Hanoi roads to the hotel.

We took some time to shower and settle in the hotel. The hotel is great they gave us tea on our arrival and carried our bags.

After about an hour of down time we headed into the crazy roads of Hanoi. Anthony was not looking forward to this. We wandered to find some lunch and ended up having a delicious lunch.

We headed further into Old Quarter and booked tickets to the 6:30pm  Water Puppet Show. Having some time to kill we headed across to Hoan Kiem Temple. It was so pretty here. We payed the 30000 VND entry and explored the surround. The lake and temple is focused on a local legend. As follows According to legend, Hoan Kiem Lake is where Le Loi returned his magic sword to the Golden Turtle. The place was stunning we spent about 40 min having a look around and taking photos.

The puppet theater was good but man are we tired. We trudged back to the hotel and crashed for the night.
