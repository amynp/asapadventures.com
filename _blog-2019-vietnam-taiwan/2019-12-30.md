We had a later start today because a few of us were trying to recuperate. We decided to head for an afternoon trip into Taichung. Taichung is actually about half way down Taiwans east coast but luckily for us we had a High Speed Rail pass so in fact the journey literally half way across the country only took 50 minutes by train.

We caught the local bus from Taichung HSR station to Rainbow Village. Rainbow Village was part of an old Veterans Village.  These villages had been built hastily, with cheap materials. They gave simple housing to the soldiers, and their families, after they retreated from Mainland China. All the villages were being torn down and this one man now called rainbow grandpa started painting these houses. Long story short the village has not been tourn down. Rainbow Grandpa who is 98 still gets up at 4 am everymornign to freshly paint parts of the village. If you want to read about him : https://www.boredpanda.com/rainbow-village-taichung-taiwan-huang-yung-fu/?utm_source=duckduckgo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organic

The village is very very cool to go to. The art is amazing. We were thrilled because raindbow Grandpa was actually around and we got to meet with him and get signed art work. It was one of the best places I have visited even if it was a tad crowded.

From here we took an uber across to Chun Shui Tang. This restaurant is where Bubble Tea originated from. I was so excited to go here because I love bubble tea. I watched a documentary on the women who worked here who invented it and was super excited!! Anyway it didn't disappoint it was the best bubble tea I have ever had (it was the size of my head) and the food was super amazing as well.

It was a great day so we took the HSR back to Taipei and tucked ourselves in as we are moving hotels tomorrow.
