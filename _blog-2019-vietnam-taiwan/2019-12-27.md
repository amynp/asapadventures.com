Today was a travel day and I was not feeling well. I think the Vietnamese food had caught up with me. In the morning I felt really dizzy and not in my head.

Regardless we were on the 3 hour flight to Taipei. I slept most of the flight and soon enough we arrived in Taiwan.

We picked up our Sim cards and jumped on the mrt to the accommodation. That was the end of me for today. I went straight to bed. Anthony was the best and bough back electrolyte drinks for me and some food and then him and Rob went out for dinner leaving me to attempt to sleep the sickness off.
