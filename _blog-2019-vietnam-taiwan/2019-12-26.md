It was our last morning on the boat and I was so sad. We had to be up super early as we were due to head to the a cave called Thien Cahn Son. We had to get there early to beat the tourist ships. Thomas took us to the cave and showed us around. It was a cave that was used by the people of the fishing village to be safe from typhoons and monsoons. The cave is huge and has very pretty limestone formations. The climb up was about 200 steps so we got a nice early morning workout.

Back on the boat we had some packing and relaxation time. We spent some time on the balcony before we had to check out.

We had a last fancy buffet breakfast and caught up with our new friends from Boston and Perth. Then it was time to leave. We took the boat back to shore and said Goodbye to the amazing Crew of Signature cruises. This cruise has been one of the most amazing things I have done. The crew were beyond fantastic. I am going to miss Tommy and Thomas so much they were amazing.

From here it was a boring three hour bus trip back to Hanoi. We freshened up and then went out for some shopping. We shopped for shoes, jackets and bags with some success. We kept walking to have dinner at a place called Bun Cha Huong Lein. It is famous for being where President Obama and Anthony Bourdain ate in Vietnam. SO much so that they have put glass around the table they ate at. The food was amazing. We then finished up the night with an egg coffee and a Bahn Mi.
